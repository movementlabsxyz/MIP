# Staking Games I
Staking Games I focus on the usage of early contract-based `ffs` implementations to collect data on the outcomes of different `ffs` implementations. The primary goal is to collect data on the Fork Stake Problem and to inform the Great Feature Selection.

There are five Staking Games in Staking Games I:

1. **Chaos Staking (1000 MOVE):** Participants encouraged to use any means to post to an MCR contract. Rewards are distributed by standard rewarding rules.
2. **Slack Channel Staking (2000 MOVE):** Participants use a Slack Bot to post different commitments to an MCR contract. Rewards are distributed by standard rewarding rules. 
3. **Volunteer Brigade (3000 MOVE):** After the introduction of the acceptor features, an MCR contract is deployed for which rewards on performing the volunteer acceptor role may be heightened. 
4. **Super Majority Attack (3000 MOVE):** Participants are split into two groups. One group is incentivized (outside the contract) to maintain an honest super-majority of stake and tally up as many commitments as possible. The other group is incentivized to attack the honest super-majority.
5. **Governor Exploits (5000 MOVE):** Administrative roles are passed around to different participants at different points in time. Commitments are made to an MCR contract with normal rewarding rules. The incentive is merely to take advantage of the administrative roles to augment the rewards.
