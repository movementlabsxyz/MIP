# Staking Games II
Staking Games II focuses on the usage the generalized implementation of `ffs` in the `ffs` repo to collect data on the outcomes of different `ffs` implementations. The primary goal is to collect data on the Fork Stake Problem and to inform the Great Feature Selection.

There are three Staking Games in Staking Games II:

1. **Chaos Staking (10000 MOVE):** Participants encouraged to use any means to post to an `ffs` post-confirmations contract. Rewards are distributed by standard rewarding rules.
2. **Longest Fork (20000 MOVE):** Participants are antagonistically incentivized to attempt to build the longest possible fork in an `ffs` post-confirmations contract which implements the Fork Stake upgrade. 
3. **Tug of War (10000 MOVE):** Participants are split into teams. Each team has a set of commitments that they are incentivized to get accepted to the `ffs` post-confirmations contract.
