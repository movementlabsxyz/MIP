# Staking Games III
Staking Games III is a comprehensive suite of staking games designed to test and validate the effectiveness of various `ffs` implementations, `baker-confirmations`, and the `movement-full-node` integration. The primary goal is to gather empirical data on the Fork Stake Problem and to inform the Great Feature Selection.

There are two Staking Games in Staking Games III:

1. **Chaos Staking (50000 MOVE):** Participants are encouraged to use any means to post to an `ffs` post-confirmations contracts, `baker-confirmations` contracts, or the `movement-full-node`. Rewards are distributed by standard rewarding rules.
2. **Cracked Window (50000 MOVE):** Participants are additional rewards for demonstrating an induced inconsistency between L1 and L2 confirmations.
