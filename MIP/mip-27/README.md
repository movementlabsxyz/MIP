# MIP-27: Contract Pipeline

- **Description**: Proposal to establish a structured pipeline for new contract deployments, aligning with the infrastructure outlined in MIP-23 while maintaining the existing Movement Token under MIP-18.
- **Authors**: [Primata](mailto:primata@movementlabs.xyz)

## Abstract

MIP-27 proposes a Contract Pipeline that leverages a timelock-based infrastructure, ensuring security and decentralization for new contract deployments. While the Movement Token (MOVEToken) continues to operate under the provisions of MIP-18, future deployments should adhere to the structure set forth by MIP-23. The pipeline includes components such as a KMS multisig for transaction proposals, off-chain voting for stakers and token holders, and a timelock mechanism for executing transactions, providing transparency and decentralized control.

## Motivation

Currently, Movement Token operates under the governance outlined in [MIP-18](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/blob/primata/mip-2/MIP/mip-18/README.md), and we may wish to maintain this setup for the time being. However, for future deployments and upgrades, we should transition to a more robust infrastructure as described in MIP-23. This approach provides decentralized control, security, and accountability through multisig setups, timelocks, and community voting mechanisms. By establishing a structured pipeline, we ensure that the development process remains transparent, auditable, and aligned with the community's interests.

## Specification

The Contract Pipeline includes the following components:

### 1. **Timelock**  

- **Role**: The timelock holds ownership of all upgradeable contracts.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that contract upgrades are executed only after a specified delay, allowing time for review and potential cancellation by stakeholders.

### 2. **KMS Multisig Setup**  

- **Role**: Proposes transactions to the timelock.
- **Components**:
  - **1 KMS Key**: Proposes transactions based on accepted tags.
  - **3 KMS Keys**: Accept transactions only if the transaction hash is contained in a GitHub release.
  - **1 KMS Key**: Schedules the timelock transaction.

### 3. **Off-Chain Voting Mechanism**  

- **Role**: Allows stakers and token holders to participate in "heat-checking" decisions, where off-chain voting provides feedback before finalizing transaction proposals.
- **Purpose**: Increases community involvement and allows for decentralized input into key governance decisions.

### 4. **Engineering Crew**  

- **Role**: The engineering team has the ability to push new contract versions for upgrades.
- **Interaction**: The engineering team collaborates with the multisig setup to ensure proposed transactions align with the accepted development standards.

### 5. **MCR Domain**  

- **Role**: This domain is composed of network stakers who can execute timelocked transactions.
- **Purpose**: Provides an additional layer of decentralized control by allowing stakers to be responsible for executing transactions after the timelock period has elapsed.

## Workflow for Releases

1. **Engineers Push Releases**:  
   - Engineers push new releases containing the necessary deployment data and transaction details. Each release tag initializes the workflow.

2. **Deployment JSON Files**:  
   - The release includes deployment JSON files following the standard proposed in MIP-23. These files include:
     - Transaction hash for signatures.
     - Bytecode reference.
     - Current deployment addresses.
     - Configuration details.

   These JSON files are the output generated by deployment scripts and provide the essential data for the release.

3. **GitHub Release**:  
   - The deployment JSON files are bundled into a GitHub release, which serves as the source of truth for the multisig setup. The release verifies the transaction hash and other deployment details before initiating the next step in the workflow.

4. **Proposal**:  
   - The KMS multisig, based on accepted GitHub release tags, proposes a transaction to the timelock. This is initiated by a KMS key responsible for proposing the transaction based on the tagged release.

5. **Signatures**:  
   - Three KMS keys approve the transaction if it matches the transaction hash contained in the GitHub release. These signatures are required to confirm the validity of the transaction.

6. **Scheduling**:  
   - Once consensus is reached, a separate KMS key schedules the timelock transaction. This step locks the transaction for a predefined period, allowing for review.

7. **Voting and Heat Checking**:  
   - During the timelock period, stakers and token holders participate in off-chain voting to provide feedback on the proposed transaction. This allows the community to give input before the final execution.

8. **Execution**:  
   - After the timelock period, the MCR domain composed of network stakers is responsible for executing the transaction, completing the deployment or upgrade process.

This combined workflow ensures transparency, security, and decentralized control over contract deployments and upgrades by integrating GitHub releases, KMS multisig, and timelock mechanisms with off-chain community feedback.

## Reference Implementation

The pipeline will leverage KMS multisig setups and GitHub releases as a mechanism for secure and auditable transaction proposals. Off-chain voting mechanisms for stakers and token holders can be implemented using existing decentralized governance platforms.

## Verification

### 1. **Correctness**  

   The pipeline's correctness relies on the successful integration of KMS multisig, timelocks, GitHub releases, and off-chain voting mechanisms. Each component's role must be clearly defined and enforced.

### 2. **Security Implications**  

- The timelock ensures that transactions are not executed immediately, allowing time for review and cancellation.
- The KMS multisig setup adds an additional layer of security by requiring multiple approvals from trusted parties.
- The use of GitHub releases ensures transparency and verifiability for each deployment.

### 3. **Performance Impacts**  

- The timelock may introduce slight delays in contract upgrades, but this is a necessary tradeoff for increased security and transparency.

### 4. **Validation Procedures**  

- Formal testing of the KMS multisig setup, timelock mechanisms, and GitHub release workflows should be conducted to ensure proper functionality.

### 5. **Peer Review and Community Feedback**  

   The proposal will be reviewed by Movement Labs engineers and the broader community for feedback before final implementation.
