## Abstract

Movement Improvement Proposals (MIPs) serve as a mechanism to propose, discuss, and adopt changes or enhancements to Movement technologies. By providing a standardized and formalized structure for these proposals, MIPs ensure that proposed improvements are well-defined, transparent, and accessible to the wider community.

## Motivation

Movement technologies continually evolve, and there's a need to ensure that the process of proposing and adopting changes is both organized and standardized. By establishing MIPs, we aim to facilitate the introduction of new features or improvements, making sure they are well-vetted, discussed, and documented. This ensures the integrity of Movement technologies, making it easier for third parties to adopt and adapt to these changes.

## Specification

A Movement Improvement Proposal (MIP) is a design document that provides information to the Movement community, describing a new feature or improvement for Movement technologies.
  
- **Structure**: Each MIP must adhere to the given template, which requires details like title, description, author, status, and more. A MIP also includes sections like Abstract, Motivation, Specification, Reference Implementation, Verification, Errata, and Appendix. 

    - An md-template is provided in the [MIP Repository](https://github.com/movemntdev/MIP) which further specifies this structure. This MIP is an example of said structure.
  
- **Lifecycle**: An MIP starts as a draft, after which it undergoes discussions and revisions. Once agreed upon, it moves to a 'published' status. An MIP can also be deprecated if it becomes obsolete.

- **Storage**: MIPs should be stored in the MIPs directory at [MIP Repository](https://github.com/movemntdev/MIP). 

- **Definitions** : Provide definitions that you think will empower the reader to quickly dive into the topic.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation or a sample MIP following the MIP template can be provided to guide potential proposers. This MIP (MIP-0) serves as a practical example, aiding in understanding the format and expectations.

## Verification

1. **Correctness**: Each MIP must convincingly demonstrate its correctness.

This MIP is correct insofar as it uses a structure established by Ethereum for Improvement Proposals which has hitherto been successful.

2. **Security Implications**: Each MIP should be evaluated for any potential security risks it might introduce to Movement technologies.

The primary security concern associated with this MIP is the exposure of proprietary technologies or information via the ill-advised formation of an MIP which the MIP process might encourage.

3. **Performance Impacts**: The implications of the proposal on system performance should be analyzed.

The primary performance concern associated with this MIP is its potential for overuse. Only specifications that are non-trivial and very high-quality should be composed as MIPs.

4. **Validation Procedures**: To the extent possible, formal, analytical, or machined-aided validation of the above should be pursued. 

I'm using spellcheck while writing this MIP. You can verify that I am using valid grammar by pasting this sentence into Google Docs.

5. **Peer Review and Community Feedback**: A section should be included that captures significant feedback from the community, which may influence the final specifications of the MIP.

The Movement Labs team is currently reviewing and assessing this process.

## Errata

Post-publication corrections, if any, to the MIPs should be documented in this section. This ensures transparency and provides readers with accurate and up-to-date information.

## Appendix

The Appendix should contain references and notes related to the MIP. Materials referenced in the MIP should be marked with specific labels (e.g., ⟨R1⟩) for easy tracking and understanding.
