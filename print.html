<p>ENTL proposes a simple challenge-reponse protocol to link Enclave usage to a given program. It additionally proposes a means of time-locking to allow the replacement of said program while maintaining security. This approach is demonstrated to be both generalizable and cryptographically sound.</p>
<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>This protocol was originally suggested as a solution to minimizing trust assumptions in the Atomic Bridge under <a href="Approved/main/MIP/mip-1/../MD/md-1">MD-1</a>. However, similar problems were encountered under Movement Labs Governance Stage 0 concerning general key usage.</p>
<h2 id="specification"><a class="header" href="#specification">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<h3 id="protocol-description"><a class="header" href="#protocol-description">Protocol Description</a></h3>
<p>The protocol is a simple challenge-response scheme performed between two parties: the Enclave, a presumed secure compute unit, and the Client, the program requesting the Enclave’s services.</p>
<p>The following messages types are exchanged between the Enclave and the Client:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SYN</strong>: the Client sends a 256-bit nonce to the Enclave.</li>
<li><strong>SYN-OK</strong>: the Enclave responds indicating it has received and accepted the nonce. This can be sent as a response to either SYN or SYN-CHECK.</li>
<li><strong>SYN-TL</strong>: the Enclave responds indicating it has the received the nonce and subjected it to a time-lock and queuer. The time-lock and place in the queue are provided as response.</li>
<li><strong>APP</strong>: the Client sends an application message to the Enclave, a 256-bit nonce for the current message, and a 256-bit nonce for the next message.</li>
<li><strong>APP-OK</strong>: the Enclave responds indicating it has processed the application message and has updated the nonce for the next message.</li>
<li><strong>APP-OK-CON</strong>: the Enclave responds indicating that it has processed the application message, has updated the nonce for the next message, and has aborted a contentious synchronization attempt.</li>
<li><strong>APP-REJ</strong>: the Enclave responds indicating it has received the application message but is rejecting it and will not update the nonce for the next message.</li>
</ul>
<p>These messages are exchanged as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Synchronization Phase</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Prior to sending its first application message, the Client generates and safely stores CSPRNG nonce and sends it to the Enclave in a SYN message.</li>
<li>The Enclave processes the SYN message:
<ul>
<li>If enclave does not have a stored nonce, this indicates that no other client has attempted to synchronize with the Enclave. The Enclave MUST accept the nonce, store the nonce, and respond with a SYN-OK message.</li>
<li>If the Enclave has a record of the nonce, this indicates that another client has attempted to synchronize with the Enclave in the past. It MUST check queue and time-lock conditions:
<ul>
<li>If the nonce is at the top of the queue and has passed its time-lock, the Enclave MUST accept, store, and respond with a SYN-OK message.</li>
<li>If the nonce is not at the top of the queue or has not passed its time-lock, the Enclave MUST respond with a SYN-TL message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Application Phase</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The Client sends an APP message to the Enclave with the application message and the nonce for the current message and the nonce for the next message.</li>
<li>The Enclave processes the APP message:
<ul>
<li>If the nonce for the current message is the expected nonce, the Enclave MUST process the application message and update the nonce for the next message. It MUST responds with an APP-OK message.</li>
<li>If the nonce for the current message is not the expected nonce, the Enclave MUST respond with an APP-REJ message.</li>
<li>If the nonce for the current message is the expected nonce but the Enclave has nonces in its time-lock queue, i.e., from other SYN messages, the Enclave MUST:
<ol>
<li>Empty the queue of all other nonces;</li>
<li>Process the application message;</li>
<li>Respond with an APP-OK-CON message.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Client MUST wait for an APP-OK, APP-REJ, or APP-OK-CON message before sending the next application message.
<ul>
<li>If the message is APP-OK or APP-OK-CON, the Client MUST send the next application message with the “next nonce” specified in the previous message.</li>
<li>If the message is APP-REJ, the Client MUST re-send the application message with the “current nonce” it used in the previous message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-application-atomic-bridge-service"><a class="header" href="#example-application-atomic-bridge-service">Example Application: Atomic Bridge Service</a></h3>
<p>To demonstrate how this protocol can be used, consider the Atomic Bridge Service.</p>
<p>To minimize trust in MLABSO, an enclave is booted which generates its own signing keys and is prepared to sign transactions to send to bridge contracts. This enclave can additionally be tooled with other application messages handlers to, for example, allow for the replacement of an initial trusted and directly accessible signing key.</p>
<p>Once the enclave has been configured, the MLABSO configures the bridge service software to start signing transactions via ENTL protocol. It synchronizes for a nonce which is immediately accepted as it is the first SYN message. The bridge service then exchanges application messages with the enclave to sign transactions. The bridge service never directly accesses the signing key, only sending application messages to the enclave.</p>
<p>A MLABSO is informed that the bridge service needs to be upgraded. Because the previous bridge service securely stored its nonce (challenges related to this discussed below), the MLABSO will need to rely on the ENTL protocol to run a new synchronization phase. This enforces a time-lock of say 20 minutes before the new bridge service has been synchronized with the enclave and can continue signing transactions.</p>
<p>Now, a malicious MLABSO decides to attempt to abuse the key. She knows she cannot directly access the key. She also knows that she will not be able to use the key until the program has synchronized to a nonce she controls. She deems discovering or replacing the nonce used in the existing program intractable. So, she must stop the service and start a new synchronization phase. This will time-lock the service for 20 minutes. However, in the end, she will have the ability to sign with the key. The MLABSO begins the synchronization phase. However, during this time, a legitimate MLABSO notices that the bridge service is being upgraded (perhaps even that it is down). The legitimate MLABSO then reviews access logs to discover the malicious MLABSO’s actions. The malicious MLABSO and her program are then removed from the system before the new bridge service can be synchronized.</p>
<h3 id="practical-considerations"><a class="header" href="#practical-considerations">Practical Considerations</a></h3>
<p>In practice, there are several phenomena regarded as external to the ENTL protocol which need to be considered in order to make it safely usable.</p>
<h4 id="securing-the-nonce"><a class="header" href="#securing-the-nonce">Securing the Nonce</a></h4>
<p>In order to avoid the possibility of malicious usage, both the current nonce and the next nonce need to be stored in a manner that is difficult to access except by the current program. We do not intend to impose cryptographically secure requirements on this storage, as that begins to invoke concepts related to the literature on succinct arguments for programs. However, there are several simpler ways that can make accessing the and using the outside  nonce difficult.</p>
<p>To describe these, it first helps to consider what enables a nonce attack and to consider the time these operations take.</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker must first obtain the nonce which takes some duration $d_E = t_E’ - t_E$.</li>
<li>The attacker then must use the nonce to send in an APP message which the Enclave will process. This takes some duration $d_S = t_S’ - t_S$.</li>
<li>In total, we may say the attack takes some duration $d_A = t_S’ - t_E’$.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the legitimate Client will have some duration $d_L = t_L’ - t_L$ over which the nonce is stored as either the current or next nonce and has not yet been used.</li>
<li>The period between when the legitimate Client first stores this nonce and when the Enclave would process it is bounded by a time $t_S’$ wherein the attacker sends the malicious APP message and $t_L$.</li>
</ol>
<p>This model of an attack leads to several prevention strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Temporal Resolution</strong>: frequently updating the nonce narrows the window $d_L$ in which the attacker can obtain the nonce and use it before the legitimate Client does. If this exceeds, the time to obtain the nonce and send it, i.e., $d_A$, the attack is impossible. It may thus be ideal for the Client to update the nonce even without a message that corresponds to is APP logic.</li>
<li><strong>Security via Obscurity</strong>: the implication throughout this MIP is that Client stores its nonce in program memory. As program memory is highly-dynamic, particularly on the stack, it would be difficult to identify the location of the nonce in memory, increasing $d_A$. This is a form of security via obscurity which could be further upgraded by data structures which further randomize the location of the nonce in memory.</li>
<li><strong>ISA-specific Approaches</strong>: there a number of ISA-specific tools which can used to make accessing certain sections of memory very difficult for even though most privileged attackers. Consider reviewing <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/community/exploring-tsx-with-software-development-emulator.html#:~:text=Intel%C2%AE%20Transactional%20Synchronization%20Extensions%20(Intel%C2%AE%20TSX)%20is%20perhaps,%E2%84%A2%20microarchitecture%20code%20name%20Haswell.">Intel TSX</a> and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/pointer-auth-v7.pdf">ARM PAC</a>.</li>
<li><strong>ENTL Hot Potato and Generalizations</strong>: the ENTL protocol can be made bidirectional and two-staged such that the Enclave also synchronizes a nonce with the Client which it expects the Client to echo with the eventual APP message. This could further reduce the time the ultimate nonce is stored in the Client’s memory and increase the time the attacker must spend to obtain and use the nonce. Generalizations and variations of this protocol could use more parties and commit-reveal schemes like Pedersen commitments to further secure the nonce.</li>

<p>This MIP introduces the Movement Gloss (MG) document type and establishes a process for introducing new glossary terms. The MG document type will be used to define terms unique to Movement Labs and to provide specific definitions for terms that are used in a unique way, underspecified in the literature, or have a specific meaning in the context of Movement Labs.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-1"><a class="header" href="#motivation-1">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>In order to communicate with more specificity in all contexts, Movement Labs should introduce a glossary. This glossary should define terms both unique to Movement Labs and general terms that are used in a unique way, underspecified in the literature, or have a specific meaning in the context of Movement Labs.</p>
<h2 id="specification-1"><a class="header" href="#specification-1">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<h3 id="glossary-1"><a class="header" href="#glossary-1">Glossary</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="Approved/main/MIP/mip-15/../GLOSSARY.html">Glossary</a> is an alphabetically ordered list of terms defined through MGs. Any term introduced through an MG MUST be declared in the Glossary.</p>
<p>The Glossary table contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Term</li>
<li>A short definition</li>
<li>The number of the MG that introduces the term</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mg-document-type"><a class="header" href="#mg-document-type">MG Document Type</a></h3>
<p>A template for the MG is provided at <a href="Approved/main/MIP/mip-15/../../md-template.html">mg-template</a>. An example MG is provided at <a href="Approved/main/MIP/mip-15/../../MG/mg-0/README.html">mg-0</a>.

<h3 id="mg-process"><a class="header" href="#mg-process">MG Process</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>A new glossary term MUST be defined in an MG document matching the provided templates.</li>
<li>An MG document MUST not be accepted unless justified in an MIP.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, herein, we justify the introduction of <a href="Approved/main/MIP/mip-15/../../MG/mg-0/README.html">MG-0</a>. MG-0 defines the term “gloss” which is used in the context of Movement Labs to denote the definition of a term as would feature as an entry in a glossary. It is important to include in the glossary both clarify as the acronym “MG” and to provide an example gloss.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Architecture of the HTLC-based Native Bridge for $MOVE token.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:franck.cassez@movementlabs.xyz">Franck Cassez</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-2"><a class="header" href="#abstract-2">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This MIP describes the high-level architecture of the <a href="https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/hashed-timelock-contracts">HTLC-based</a> <code>$MOVE</code> token Native Bridge. The architecture describes the main bridge components and high-level requirements.</p>
<h2 id="definitions"><a class="header" href="#definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Bridge</strong>: The bridge that allows the transfer of tokens between L1 and L2, which hold <code>$L1MOVE</code> and <code>$L2MOVE</code> token, respectively. The native bridge has the capability to mint <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens.</li>
<li><strong><code>$L1MOVE</code></strong> (or <code>$MOVE</code>) : ERC-20 type token with the source contract on L1</li>
<li><strong><code>$L2MOVE</code></strong> :  Token that is created on L2 after <code>$L1MOVE</code> token is locked on L1. We also say <code>$L1MOVE</code> is bridged from L1 to L2. <code>$L2MOVE</code> may publicly also be called <code>$MOVE</code> but as this causes confusion, here we stick to <code>$L2MOVE</code> to make clear this token lives on L2.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation-2"><a class="header" href="#motivation-2">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The Movement chain (L2) uses the <code>$L2MOVE</code> token to pay for gas fees. As a result users need to hold <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens to pay for their transactions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
The <em>native</em> <code>$L1MOVE</code>token is an ERC-20 contract on Ethereum (L1).  By native, we mean that this is the location where the token is minted and burned and where the total supply is set and possibly modified (inflation/deflation). The <strong><code>$L1MOVE</code> token reserve</strong>  is in the L1 contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use the Movement chain and pay for gas fees, a user will acquire <code>$L1MOVE</code> (native) tokens on L1, and <em>bridge</em> them to L2. On the L2 they can use the token to pay for gas fees or with any other dApps that transact the <code>$L2MOVE</code> token.
Later, a user can choose to migrate their <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens back to the L1 at any time (thereby converting them to <code>$L1MOVE</code>). These cross-chain assets’s transfers are usually done through a component called a <em>bridge</em>.</p>
<p>In this MIP an HTLC-based bridge, which is the current implementation, is discussed which provides trustlessness.</p>
<h3 id="a-standard-bridge-architecture"><a class="header" href="#a-standard-bridge-architecture">A standard bridge architecture</a></h3>
<p>The process of transferring tokens across different chains is implemented with a <em>bridge</em> (between the chains).</p>
<p>There are several choices for the architecture of a bridge, and we describe here a classical bridge with a  <em>lock-mint</em> protocol (see Chainlink’s <a href="https://chain.link/education-hub/cross-chain-bridge">What Is a Cross-Chain Bridge?</a> for a quick introduction to types of bridges).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]<br />
The transfer of tokens is one-to-one: a user bridges $k$ <code>$L1MOVE</code> tokens to L2, and they receive $k$ <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens. Same one-to-one ratio applies from L2 to L1.  The bridge does not allow for <em>swapping</em> tokens against other tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lock-and-Mint</strong>. The main idea of the <em>lock-mint</em> protocol is as follows. For the sake of simplicity, assume the two chains (L1 and L2) have only one user and the user has an account <code>l1acc</code> on L1, and another account <code>l2acc</code> on L2.  We also assume that each transfer is for one token.</p>
<p>If the user wants to bridge one <code>$L1MOVE</code> to L2, then</p>
<ul>
<li>they <em>lock</em> (one) <code>$L1MOVE</code> into a (escrow) contract <code>L1InitiatorBridge</code> on the L1 side. To do so they transfer (one) <code>$L1MOVE</code> from <code>l1acc</code> to the <code>L1InitiatorBridge</code> contract;</li>
<li>once the contract <code>L1InitiatorBridge</code> receives the <code>$L1MOVE</code> it emits a corresponding event <code>FundReceivedFrom(l1acc)</code> to the L1 (append-only) logs,</li>
<li>a <em>relayer</em> monitors the logs on the L1 side, and when they see the <code>FundReceived(l1acc)</code> event, they send a transaction to an L2 contract, <code>L2CounterPartyBridge</code> asking the contract to mint (one)  <code>$L2MOVE</code>,</li>
<li>the user requests the transfer of the newly minted <code>$L2MOVE</code> to their account <code>l2acc</code> on L2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Burn-and-Unlock</strong>. The transfer from L2 to L1 is similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user transfers (one) <code>$L2MOVE</code> to the <code>L2InitiatorBridge</code> contract. The <code>L2InitiatorBridge</code> burns (destroys) the token and emits an event
<code>TokenBurned(l2acc)</code> to the L2 (append-only) logs,</li>
<li>a relayer monitors the L2 logs and when they see the event <code>TokenBurned(l2acc)</code>, they send a transaction to the L1 contract <code>L1CounterPartyBridge</code> to <em>unlock</em> an <code>$L1MOVE</code> token for account <code>l1acc</code>,</li>
<li>the user (on L1)  requests transfer of one <code>$L1MOVE</code> from the  <code>L1CounterPartyBridge</code> to their account on L1,   <code>l1acc</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This protocol can be implemented with three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>two contracts on the L1 side,</li>
<li>one contract (module) on the L2 (Move) side,</li>
<li>a relayer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hash-time-lock-contracts-htlc"><a class="header" href="#hash-time-lock-contracts-htlc">Hash-time-lock contracts (HTLC)</a></h3>
<p>The proposed native bridge employs Hash-time-lock-contracts (<a href="https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/hashed-timelock-contracts">HTLC</a>). HTLC utilizes two main concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time Locks: These ensure transactions complete within a set period. Or funds revert to their owners, preventing loss from delays or non-completion.</li>
<li>Hash Locks: A secret is required to unlock funds, ensuring only participants who fulfill the swap conditions can access the assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two mechanisms guarantee atomicity (complete swap or no swap) and trustlessness (no reliance on the counterparty’s honesty), making the transfer secure for cryptocurrency bridging.</p>
<h3 id="attacks-on-bridges"><a class="header" href="#attacks-on-bridges">Attacks on bridges</a></h3>
<p>As can be seen the protocol above has distinct phases, and many things can go wrong. For example</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User becomes unable to retrieve funds</strong>. The user locks their funds in the L1 contract, but the relayer never issues the minting transaction. In that case the user may never be able to retrieve their funds. What we want is some <em>atomicity</em> between the steps: if the user locks their funds, then either the corresponding minting transaction occurs, or if it does not (and we may set a time bound), the funds are returned to the user on L1.</li>
<li><strong>Crediting the wrong user</strong>. Another source of difficulty is to make sure that only the user <code>l2acc</code> can redeem the <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens. i.e. they are not credited to another user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the possibly issues have been thoroughly studied and bridges have been in operation for several years. However hacks related to bridges account for more than 1/3 of the total hacks value which tends to indicate that bridges are vulnerable, frequently attacked, and should be designed carefully. Infamous attacks are two Ronin bridge attacks and a Nomad bridge attack</p>

</ul>
<p>Some solutions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02029">XChainWatcher</a> rely on monitoring bridges and detect attacks.</p>

<h3 id="bridging-from-l1-to-l2"><a class="header" href="#bridging-from-l1-to-l2">Bridging from L1 to L2</a></h3>
<p>Let <code>user1</code> be a user with an account on L1, and <code>user2</code> be a user with an account on L2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
<strong>Simple context (without loss of generality)</strong>
Assume <code>user1</code> wants to transfer <code>1</code> <code>$L1MOVE</code> tokens, we refer to as <code>asset</code> in the sequel, to <code>user2</code> on L2.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="transfer-steps"><a class="header" href="#transfer-steps">Transfer steps</a></h4>
<p>A successful transfer requires the following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>user1</em> locks their L1<code>$L1MOVE</code> tokens in the <code>AtomicBridgeInitiatorMOVE.sol</code> contract on L1. The contract emits an event <code>BridgeTransferPending</code> to the L1 logs. At this point in time the transfer becomes <code>INITIALIZED</code> on L1.</li>
<li>A <em>relayer</em> monitors the L1 logs and when they see the <code>BridgeTransferPending</code> event, they send a transaction to the <code>atomic_bridge_counterparty.move</code> module on L2 asking the module to prepare the minting of <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens. The status of the bridge transfer on L2 becomes <code>PENDING</code>. An event <code>BridgeTransferLocked</code> is emitted to the L2 logs.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
Check point: This is the end of the first phase. Next phase must be triggered by <code>user2</code>.
At that point the bridge transfers details are known by the L1 and the L2.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><em>user2</em> (or anybody with the secret) sends a transaction to the <code>atomic_bridge_counterparty.move</code> module on L2 asking to <em>complete the bridge transfer</em>. If the transfer has been properly initialised (step 2 above), this results in minting tokens and transfers the minted tokens to the <code>user2</code> account. If successful, an event <code>BridgeTransferComplete</code> is emitted to the L2 logs. The status of the transfer on L2 becomes <code>COMPLETED</code>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
Check point: The transfer is completed on L2.
At that stage the <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens are in the <code>user2</code> account on L2.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The relayer monitors the L2 logs and when they see the <code>BridgeTransferComplete</code> event, they send a transaction to the <code>AtomicBridgeInitiatorMOVE.sol</code> contract on L1 to <em>complete the bridge transfer</em>. This closes the status of the transfer on L1 and the status of the transfer becomes <code>COMPLETED</code>. An event <code>BridgeTransferComplete</code> is emitted to the L1 logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>user1</code> can claim a refund on L1 after a certain time, <code>timelock1</code>, has elapsed.
This introduces possible concurrent unwanted behaviors, and a timelock has to be set on L2, <code>timelock2</code>, to prevent the relayer from completing the transfer on L2 after the refund has been claimed on L1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the steps above:</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="Approved/main/MIP/mip-39/L1ToL2.png" alt="alt text" />
<strong>Figure 1</strong>: Time chart of the bridge protocol from L1 to L2.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>[!CAUTION]
Fault-tolerance
As there can be crashes or delays or network partitions, the protocol should be <em>fault-tolerant</em> to a certain extent.
This is done by the use of <code>timelocks</code> on the L1 and L2 sides that restrict the operations above to occur within <em>bounded time windows</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to ensure that the funds can only be transferred from <code>user1</code> to <code>user2</code>, <code>user1</code> locks (step 1. <code>init_bridge_transfer()</code>) the funds with a <code>secret</code>.
To unlock the funds on L2, <code>user2</code> needs to prove they know the secret when they request the funds on L2 (step 3. <code>complete_bridge_transfer()</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]<br />
<strong>Requirements for the bridge protocol</strong>
The desired properties of the bridge protocol (L1 to L2) are  <strong>atomicity</strong> and <strong>liveness</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[safety-1] <code>user1</code> SHOULD be able to initiate a transfer at any time.</li>
<li>[safety-2] <code>user1</code> MUST NOT be able to <strong>get a refund</strong> if the transfer <strong>has been completed on L2</strong> and <code>user2</code> has the funds on L2.</li>
<li>[liveness-1] if the relayer is live and relays all events within a bounded time, <code>user1</code> SHOULD be able to complete the transfer on L2 and get the asset on L2.</li>
<li>[liveness-2] if the transfer has not been completed by the L2 within a time window <code>timelock1</code> since <code>user1</code> initiated the transfer, <code>user1</code> MUST be able to get a refund on L1.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As can be seen in the diagram above, the safety of the bridge may depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the relayer being live and <strong>relaying all events within a bounded time</strong>,</li>
<li>the timelocks’ values <strong>being set</strong> correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance if <code>timeLock2</code> is larger than <code>timeLock1</code>, the following scenario can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>complete_bridge_transfer()</code> tx completes on L2 and funds are transferred to <code>users2</code>,</li>
<li>the relayer does not relay the event <code>BridgeTransferCompleted!</code> fast enough,</li>
<li><code>user1</code> on L1 asks for a refund, <code>request_refund()</code>, which is successful and gets the asset back.</li>
</ul>
<p>The correctness of the implementation depends on the timelocks’ values and is addressed in the Verification section below.</p>

<h2 id="verification-2"><a class="header" href="#verification-2">Verification</a></h2>
<h3 id="bridge-l1-to-l2"><a class="header" href="#bridge-l1-to-l2">Bridge L1 to L2</a></h3>
<p>The correctness of the bridge operation from L1 to L2 depends on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the timelocks’ values,</li>
<li>the control of the keys to operate the bridge,</li>
<li>the verification of the <code>secret</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume that the keys are not compromised, and that the logics in the contracts ensure that the secret <code>user1</code> uses is requested by the <code>complete_bridge_transfer</code> tx on L2. This can tested on L1 (Solidity) and formally verified on L2 (Move and Move Prover).</p>
<p>In this section we focus on the timelocks’ values, as this involves a sequence of operations on L1 and L2.
We model the bridge transactions (L1 to L2) and the transfers of assets with a <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/TCS94.pdf">network of timed automata</a>.
The safety and liveness properties are defined by temporal logics formulas and can be verified with model-checking tools such as <a href="http://www.uppaal.org/">UPPAAL</a>.</p>
<p>The UPPAAL model is available in <a href="Approved/main/MIP/mip-39/./uppaal-models/bridge-up-v2.xml">this-file</a>.
To reproduce the results and check the properties on the model, you need a working version of UPPAAL.</p>
<p>The results of the model-checking verification are as follows: let $maxRelayerDelay$ be the <strong>maximum delay</strong> for the relayer to relay an event, and $timeLock1$ and $timeLock2$ be the timelocks on L1 and L2 respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
<strong>Verification results</strong>
We have <strong>proved</strong> (model-checked with UPPAAL) the following properties (valid using the versions of the contracts below):</p>
<ul>
<li>contract (Move): <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/blob/movement/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/atomic_bridge.move">atomic_bridge.move</a>, commit <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/commit/c1ecd0afd250fd71fe9ffc168b2ba7bafa97ffb3">c1ecd0a</a></li>
<li>contracts (Solidity): <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/blob/main/protocol-units/bridge/contracts/src/AtomicBridgeInitiatorMOVE.sol">AtomicBridgeInitiatorMOVE.sol</a> and <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/blob/main/protocol-units/bridge/contracts/src/AtomicBridgeCounterpartyMOVE.sol">AtomicBridgeCounterpartyMOVE.sol</a> in this commit  <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/commit/200c9f9d10fa8863b096ab3cd5442938c358a091">200c9f9</a></li>
<li>[safety-1]: there exists an execution path such that <code>user1</code> initiates and completes a transfer on L2 within a time window $timeLock1$,</li>
<li>[safety-2]: <strong>Provided</strong> the relayer relays the events within a time window $maxRelayerDelay$, <strong>AND</strong> $timelock1 &gt; timelock2 + 2 \times  maxRelayerDelay$, <code>user1</code> cannot get a refund on L1 if the transfer has been completed on L2,</li>
<li>[liveness-1] if the relayer is not down, <code>user2</code> can get the funds on L2, after $timelock1 + 2 * maxRelayerDelay$ time units.</li>
<li>[liveness-2] if the transfer is not successful on L2 within $timelock1$, <code>user1</code> can get a refund on L1 (after $timelock1$ time units).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that [safety-2] does hold if the relayer is down for more than $maxRelayerDelay$, or the timelocks are not set correctly.</p>
<h3 id="bridge-l2-to-l1"><a class="header" href="#bridge-l2-to-l1">Bridge L2 to L1</a></h3>
<p>The only difference between L1 to L2 is the way assets are created/destroyed. However, the formal model abstracts away this difference and the same properties hold for the L2 to L1 bridge.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-3"><a class="header" href="#abstract-3">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>Movement’s L2 system will progress through various changes during its life, and each stage is presented through a new L2 model (which we call <strong>progressive L2 model</strong>). Thus a given progressive L2 model describes as a particular stage in the evolution of the L2 system.  A given progressive L2 model stage is defined through the sum of its improvements and it may encompass components that are not directly related to each other.</p>
<p>We propose a set of conventions including naming, formatting, and related standards to assist reviewing proposals for said models. Finally a collection point of these terms to provide an overview</p>
<h2 id="motivation-3"><a class="header" href="#motivation-3">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>In order to facilitate the development of L2 systems, it is important to have a clear and consistent way to propose and review models for these systems. This MIP aims to provide a set of conventions for proposing progressive L2 models that will help to ensure that proposals are clear, consistent, and easy to review.</p>
<h2 id="specification-3"><a class="header" href="#specification-3">Specification</a></h2>
<p>Progressive L2 models should adhere to conventions of the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>naming</strong>: apply a standard naming format.</li>
<li><strong>acknowledgement of standards</strong>: acknowledge the conventions of this MIP.</li>
<li><strong>summary table</strong>: a table succinctly noting key features of the model.</li>
<li><strong>statement towards progression</strong>: a statement of how the model suits a progressive approach to L2 design and release.</li>
<li><strong>pros and cons</strong>: a list of pros and cons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming"><a class="header" href="#naming">Naming</a></h3>
<p>All proposed progressive L2 models MUST adopt a name of the form “The [Location] Model” where [Location] is a location where the proposal was drafted or a similarly symbolic location. This name should be the title of the associated MIP.</p>
<p>In text, the model SHOULD be referred to as “[Location] Model,” that is, the name of the model in title case.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgement-of-standards"><a class="header" href="#acknowledgement-of-standards">Acknowledgement of Standards</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the “Specification” section of the MIP, the author MUST include the following markdown snippet:</p>
<pre><code>We acknowledge and apply the conventions of [MIP-53: Conventions for Proposing Progressive L2 Models](../mip-53/).
</code></pre>
<h3 id="summary-table"><a class="header" href="#summary-table">Summary Table</a></h3>
<p>All proposed progressive L2 models MUST complete the following table:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Evaluation</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>X</td><td>When to use</td><td>A brief general description of the circumstances under which the model is appropriate.</td></tr>

</ul>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Atomic Bridge service relies on trusted keys for relaying events between chains. Without governance or multisig contracts, the risk entailed by a compromised bridge key is significant. Even with logic safeguarding against direct mint operations, fraudulent events on either chain can still be synthesized.</p>
<p>The desiderata herein recognize standard governance as generally the best means of managing these kinds of risks in general. Specialized contracts can be used to accumulate votes and make it difficult for a single actor to compromise bridge security.</p>
<p>However, in the case of bridging, inactive or unreliable governance can be a significant risk as well. In effect, the changes represented by the in-flight message represent those already agreed upon by the destination chain’s governance. These are then subject to a smaller, potentially less-secure governance process before being relayed to the destination chain. The risk of DOS attacks on this governance process is thus high.</p>
<p>Until a robust design for relaying bridge messages based on votes is attained, bridge trust assumptions are offset by a presumed trustworthy bridge signing service which uses known keys that would be controlled by Movement Labs.</p>
<p>This desiderata requests a means to minimize the risk of a compromised bridge key without relying on on-chain governance.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Provide a model for MCR and suggest a mechanism for handling network partitions and asynchrony.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:liam@movementlabs.xyz">Liam Monninger</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p>MCR provides a stake-based settlement mechanism used in Movement Lab’s Suzuka Network. In it’s current form, it does not take any steps to account for network partitions or, more generally, asynchrony.</p>
<p>Henceforth, we will simply refer to network partitions, as all forms of asynchrony with which we are concerned can be modeled as such. Even if a node is not technically offline, the remainder of this disiderata will be concerned with the case in which it is not able to commit meaningfully to the current block height.</p>
<p>It is important to account for network partitions in a manner consistent with the game theory of MCR. In the current implementation, a simple race is run to $\frac{2}{3}$ of the network’s stake. Currently, there is no model for slashing or rewarding. So, not participating in that race to $\frac{2}{3}$ of the network’s stake is not a meaningfully punished. Presuming there would be a reward for participating, this may create an incentive to run an unreliable node which may often fail to commit to the current block height.</p>
<p>The same condition could also be seen as an attack vector if rewards and punishments were in place. A malicious actor could aim to partition the network via generating conditions for fast commitment amongst certain nodes–perhaps via something similar to the <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/rfcs/pull/29">Peer Attack described in RFC-29</a>. This would allow their stake to increase via rewards while the targeted minority stake would be slashed. The attacker may be able to keep apply this attack until they have a majority of stake.</p>
<p>These and other phenomena are listed in the desiderata below.</p>

<h3 id="d1-model-for-network-partitions-as-absent-commitments-to-mcr"><a class="header" href="#d1-model-for-network-partitions-as-absent-commitments-to-mcr">D1: Model for Network Partitions as Absent Commitments to MCR</a></h3>
<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: A researcher or protocol implementer can refer to a formal model for network partitions in MCR, ultimately deriving from it the logic necessary to implement slashing and rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Network partitions effectively result in absent commitments to the current block height. While not changing the stake needing to agree on the current height, the slashing or rewarding based on this absent commitment should be expected to impact behavior in the repeated game of MCR.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple way to approach would be to model the value of a node’s commitment or absenteeism to honest-agreeing, honest-disagreeing, dishonest-agreeing, and dishonest-disagreeing participants. This could then be adapted into a more complex model with shifting preferences.</li>
<li>The literature on absenteeism in repeated games is generally a bit sparse and particularly so–on first review–for topics in computer science.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d2-research-and-design-for-commitment-tolerance-window"><a class="header" href="#d2-research-and-design-for-commitment-tolerance-window">D2: Research and Design for Commitment Tolerance Window</a></h3>
<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: A researcher or protocol implementer can understand why or why not a commitment tolerance window is necessary for MCR and why a particular design for this window was chosen.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: It has been proposed that a commitment tolerance window would soften network partitions. That is, allowing participants to receive a reward or penalty after the needed stake has committed to the current block height could prevent the kind kind of stake drift and attacks described above.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the following parameters for the commitment tolerance window:
<ul>
<li>Reward decay: the function describing the diminishing returns of rewards later in the window.</li>
<li>Penalty decay: the function describing the increasing returns of penalties later in the window.</li>
<li>Vote decay: the function describing the diminishing returns of votes later in the window. This would only be useful if previous rounds of voting are considered in the current round.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: A researcher or protocol implementer can understand the <a href="Approved/main/MD/md-3/./asychronous-upgrades-problem.html">Asynchronous Upgrades, Fork Creation, and Fork Stake Problems</a> and how they are addressed in MCR.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: These are problems encountered under asynchrony and systems addressing asynchrony which if not addressed would bring down the network.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by reviewing the <a href="Approved/main/MD/md-3/./asychronous-upgrades-problem.html">Asynchronous Upgrades, Fork Creation, and Fork Stake Problems</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Andreas Penzkofer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h2>
<p>In order to communicate with more specificity in all contexts, Movement Labs should introduce a glossary. This glossary should define terms both unique to Movement Labs and general terms that are used in a unique way, underspecified in the literature, or have a specific meaning in the context of Movement Labs.</p>
<h2 id="desiderata-2"><a class="header" href="#desiderata-2">Desiderata</a></h2>
<!--
  List out the specific desiderata. Each entry should consist of:

  1. Title: A concise name for the desideratum.
  2. User Journey: A one or two-sentence statement focusing on the "user" (could be a human, machine, software, etc.) and their interaction or experience.
  3. Description (optional): A more detailed explanation if needed.
  4. Justification: The reasoning behind the desideratum. Why is it necessary or desired?
  5. Recommendations (optional): Suggestions or guidance related to the desideratum.

<p><strong>Justification</strong>: A common format for glossary entries will make it easier to maintain and update the glossary.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new formatted document for glossary entries in the MIP repository. Call this document an MG, short for Movement Gloss.</li>
<li>Include sections for (1) term, (2) authorship, (3) concise definition, (4) catalog of references to definitions or usages of the term in other contexts, (5) example usages, and (6) errata.</li>

<h2 id="abstract-4"><a class="header" href="#abstract-4">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The format of a well-known file defining migrations of the DA blob format enacted on specified
block heights.
This would be a hardfork or coordinated approach (TODO: clarify terminology) to upgrades, in that
each node participating in the network SHOULD be deployed with an up to date copy of the file
describing the migrations up to and above the current block height.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-4"><a class="header" href="#motivation-4">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>In order to allow for safe upgrades, data model changes, and DA migrations, it has been proposed that we provide a data format which describes the canonical state of the DA over time.</p>
<h2 id="specification-4"><a class="header" href="#specification-4">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<h3 id="da-migration-configuration-format"><a class="header" href="#da-migration-configuration-format">DA Migration Configuration Format</a></h3>
<p>The format of a well-known file defining migrations is a JSON serialization of a map where keys
indicate the block height at which the configuration in the value starts applying. The values are
objects with named fields specifying the format settings. The top-level configuration envelope
specifies the current version of the format to permit breaking changes in the future.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "version": 1,
  "migrations": {
    "123456": {
      "namespace": "deadbeef01234567890",
      "transaction_format": 1,
      "block_format": 2,
      "ordering_rule": 3,
      "node_version": "1.2"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>the Rust definition of the value struct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DASettings {
    namespace: Namespace,
    transaction_format: TransactionFormatVersion,
    block_format: BlockFormatVersion,
    ordering_rule: OrderingRuleVersion,
    node_version: NodeVersionReq,
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>Namespace</code> is the data type representing a Celestia namespace ID with the
human-readable serialization as a hex string.
The <code>*Version</code> types are enums initially defined with a single <code>V1</code> member each.
<code>NodeVersionReq</code> serializes into a SemVer-conforming version specification in the
<em>MAJOR</em><code>.</code><em>MINOR</em> format.</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-managing-migrations"><a class="header" href="#principles-of-managing-migrations">Principles of managing migrations</a></h3>
<p>Each new entry in the migration table SHALL use a unique Celestia namespace identifier to prevent
confusion and detect accidental misconfiguration early.</p>
<p>The configuration in all nodes in the network SHOULD be updated well in advance of the block height
at which a new change is introduced. The expected process in governance stage 0 is a coordinated
upgrade.</p>
<p>The <code>node_version</code> field gives the semver minimum version of the Suzuka full node software that is
REQUIRED to use these settings. A node that does not satisfy the version requirement for any of the
encountered entries MUST reject the configuration and report an error.</p>
<p>The producers and consumers of DA blobs MUST implement all versions encountered in the configuration
file and apply the settings accordingly to the block height of the data blobs. No mixing of
different DA formats between blobs submitted by correct nodes for the same block height is
supported by this specification.</p>
<h3 id="future-evolution-of-the-da-migration-configuration-format"><a class="header" href="#future-evolution-of-the-da-migration-configuration-format">Future evolution of the DA migration configuration format</a></h3>
<p>New fields can be added to the <code>DASettings</code> structures in future revisions
of this specifications without changing the value of the top-level
<code>version</code> field. Implementations SHALL ignore the fields not defined in
the revision of the specification they support. If interpretation of such newly
added field values in a specific migration requires behavior not supported
by older versions of the node software, this SHOULD be communicated to
non-compliant nodes with the compatibility requirement in the <code>node_version</code>
field.</p>
<p>Any values of known fields of <code>DASettings</code> that are not supported by the current
implementation SHALL result in rejecting the configuration and reporting an error.
The implementation MAY check the compatibility requirement given by <code>node_version</code>
before reporting errors on unsupported values.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-5"><a class="header" href="#abstract-5">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>We propose NB-FFS Decoupled Demurrage as a variant of <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/40">NB-FFS Decoupled</a> which issues a demurrage token as an LP Token reward. This approach allows the FFS reward mechanism to manipulate the supply of its rewards s.t. a new token generation event is not strictly required. We review demurrage strategies in general, highlighting several approaches which are particularly applicable in the NB-FFS context.</p>
<p>We also introduce <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled-demurrage/MIP/mip-42/../../MG/mg-n/README.html">MG-n</a> which defines the term “demurrage token.”</p>
<h2 id="motivation-5"><a class="header" href="#motivation-5">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>NB-FFS Decoupled Demurrage is an extension to the response to <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a>. It provides usage of the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply. This extension allows for greater flexibility in the reward mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="specification-5"><a class="header" href="#specification-5">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<p>NB-FFS Decoupled Demurrage identifies two primary controls over the LP token with respect to the L1 staking token:</p>
<ol>
<li>The supply of the LP token.</li>
<li>Vouchers issued for purchasing the L1 staking token with the LP token.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other controls are considered market mechanisms and are not considered in this MIP.</p>
<h3 id="supply-of-the-lp-token"><a class="header" href="#supply-of-the-lp-token">Supply of the LP Token</a></h3>
<p>Simply put, FFS may be increase the supply of the LP token by minting for the purpose of rewarding LPs. This approach allows flexibility in the reward mechanism. But, assuming other market conditions hold, this means LP tokens holders are subject to dilution and the value of the LP token is subject to inflation. This ultimately assigns a negative interest rate to the LP token w.r.t. to the L1 staking token which has a fixed supply.</p>
<p>To formalize this relationship, consider the following.</p>
<p>Let:</p>
<ul>
<li>$S_{LP}(t)$ denote the total supply of LP tokens at time $ t $,</li>
<li>$R_{LP}(t)$ denote the reward rate in LP tokens,</li>
<li>$P_{L1}$ denote the price or value of the L1 staking token (fixed) in terms of the LP token, and</li>
<li>$P_{LP}(t)$ denote the price of the LP token in terms of $ P_{L1} $.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Supply Inflation Rate</strong>: $\Delta S_{LP}(t) = S_{LP}(t) \cdot R_{LP}(t)$ where $R_{LP}(t)$ represents the proportional increase in LP tokens over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effective Dilution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As new tokens are minted, each LP token’s value in terms of the L1 token $P_{L1}$ decreases: $P_{LP}(t+1) = \frac{P_{LP}(t)}{1 + R_{LP}(t)}$</li>
<li>Since $R_{LP}(t) &gt; 0$, we have:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-math">1 + R_{LP}(t) &gt; 1 \implies \frac{P_{LP}(t)}{1 + R_{LP}(t)} &lt; P_{LP}(t) \implies P_{LP}(t+1) &lt; P_{LP}(t)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Negative Interest Rate</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The “negative interest rate” on LP holdings with respect to L1 can be approximated as
$\text{Interest Rate} \approx -R_{LP}(t)$
where the LP token depreciates due to the supply increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="vouchers"><a class="header" href="#vouchers">Vouchers</a></h3>
<p>The governing body can issue vouchers to purchase the L1 staking token with the LP token. Voucher MUST contain a known value of the L1 staking token which can be purchased with the LP token.</p>
<p>This is a form of demurrage, as the LP token is subject to a negative interest rate w.r.t. the L1 staking token. The voucher system, however, allows the governing body to influence the rate at which the LP token depreciates. This is critical to the success of the demurrage token as a reward which appropriately incentivizes FFS staking.</p>
<h3 id="demurrage-strategies"><a class="header" href="#demurrage-strategies">Demurrage Strategies</a></h3>
<p>There are several categories of general demurrage strategies which may be applied to the LP token. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supply Only</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The governing body may choose to only increase the supply of the LP token. This is the simplest form of demurrage and is equivalent to a negative interest rate on LP holdings.</li>
<li>This approach does not require the issuance of vouchers. The market will determine the rate at which the LP token depreciates.</li>
<li>Because the supply will increase with rewards and rewards will increase with honest FFS participation, this approach essentially applies diminishing returns to FFS staking directly in proportion to honest participation. That is, FFS cannot adjust rewards rates without have an immediate negative impact on the value of the LP token.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Voucher Curves</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The governing body supplies vouchers with a defined curve for purchasing the L1 staking token with the LP token.</li>
<li>This approach allows the governing body to transparently adjust the rate at which the LP token depreciates.</li>
<li>An asymptotic curve may be used to ensure that the LP token retains some value even as the supply increases indefinitely.</li>
<li>Ultimately, the voucher curve must be defined in terms of the available supply of the L1 staking token granted to the voucher otherwise an overdraft could occur.</li>
<li>The area under the voucher curve represents the total value of the L1 staking token that can be purchased with the LP token. The voucher curve need not be non-decreasing nor non-increasing, but must respect this constraint.</li>
<li>The voucher curve can consider other input parameters so long as the area under the curve is bounded by the available supply of the L1 staking token.</li>
<li>Because the voucher-curve can be increasing, FFS can adjust its rewards rates without an immediate negative impact on the value of the LP token. This allows FFS to adjust rewards rates in response to market conditions or participation without immediately devaluing the LP token.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Governed Voucher</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A voting mechanism can be used to set the voucher curve. This allows the governing body to adjust the rate at which the LP token depreciates in response to market conditions or participation.</li>
<li>The curve selected by the voting mechanism must respect the constraint that the area under the curve is bounded by the available supply of the L1 staking token.</li>
<li>The electorate generally should not be the participants in the FFS system, as this would incentivize participants to vote for vouchers which benefit themselves in the short-term at the expense of the long-term value of the LP token.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Participation Voucher</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The voucher defines its curve in terms of some inverse of the participation rate of FFS.</li>
<li>Participation can be measured in terms of variables such as stake and throughput.</li>
<li>Generally, tying voucher curves to participation results in conditions which may incentivize inducing unfavorable participation rates to reap greater benefits of the voucher.</li>
<li>If rewards are freely tradeable and not marked with an epoch, LP token holders may wait to redeem their rewards until participation is low, preventing actual low-participation committee members from benefitting from this incentive. For this reason, in most cases, FFS itself should handle low-participation incentives rather than the LP token, i.e., by issuing greater rewards during periods of low participation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>LP Token Futures Voucher</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Let $\alpha$ represent the future multiplier for the LP token in the voucher. The governing token issues vouchers redeemable for $\alpha \cdot \text{LP}$ at a future time $t_f$.</li>
<li>Users can either claim the L1 staking token immediately or wait to claim the LP token later, with the future multiplier.</li>
<li>When L1 price appreciation outpaces $\alpha$, it incentivizes LP token holding, as users anticipate a higher future payoff. Because LP token then has a greater market value, FFS can reward LP token holders with a smaller number of LP tokens. FFS need only look-up the volume of futures held to determine the appropriate reward rate.</li>
<li>This dynamic strengthens the correlation between LP and L1 values, stabilizing LP token depreciation and aligning incentives around L1’s future value. Importantly, it also allows the reward rate to capture market effects that counteract the negative interest rate on LP holdings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="standard-demurrage-strategy"><a class="header" href="#standard-demurrage-strategy">Standard Demurrage Strategy</a></h3>
<p>We propose a standard demurrage strategy for NB-FFS Decoupled Demurrage consisting of three key components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step-down to Asymptotic (SDA) Voucher Curve</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The governing body issues vouchers with a step-down curve. This curve is defined by a series of steps, each with a fixed value of the L1 staking token that can be purchased with the LP token.</li>
<li>After a fixed number of steps, the voucher curve becomes asymptotic. This ensures that the LP token retains some value even as the supply increases indefinitely.</li>
<li>This removes complexities associated with governance and participation-based vouchers, as the voucher curve is fixed and transparent.</li>
<li>The periods of fixed rate introduce stability in the LP token value, while the asymptotic curve ensures that the LP token retains some value even as the supply increases indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inverse Future Multiplier</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A futures contract is issued for the LP token wherein the multiplier is the inverse of the SDA voucher curve.</li>
<li>In addition to the market-alignment benefits of a general futures voucher, the inversion with the SDA voucher curve ensures allows for:
<ol>
<li>The early portion of demurrage period to incentivize rapid divestment from the LP token into the L1 staking token.</li>
<li>The later portion of the demurrage period to relying on market effects to slow LP token depreciation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FFS Reward Minting</strong>:
<ul>
<li>FFS mints LP tokens to reward LPs.</li>
<li>FFS uses the futures contract to determine the appropriate reward rate for LPs, minting fewer LP tokens when the volume of futures held is high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This MIP describes the structure of the gas fees and overall resource consumption needed to execute, and post a transaction to the DA/L1.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-6"><a class="header" href="#motivation-6">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The transaction fees on L2s are multi-dimensional [<a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-10">10</a>]. They comprise of <em>execution fees</em>, <em>settlement fees</em> and <em>data availability fees</em>.
This MIP describes what the different types of fees are, and how the transaction fees can be computed.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-this-mip"><a class="header" href="#scope-of-this-mip">Scope of this MIP</a></h2>
<p>This MIP applies to costs/fees <strong>related to executing Move bytecode</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
It does not cover the extended future framework where EVM bytecode can be executed on a Movement chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Althought the costs (in terms of resources consumption) are expressed in gas units when executing Move and EVM bytecode, the gas units are <strong>not comparable</strong>, e.g. the minimum gas for an EVM transaction is 21000 gas units, whereas for Move-Aptos it is 700 gas units. As a result designing a fee mechanism for Movement chains that support Move and EVM bytecodes will require some careful adjustments and analysis of the different fee structures (Move and EVM).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
This MIP does not cover <em>staking</em> (and slashing and rewards) for validators.</p>

<h2 id="fee-structure"><a class="header" href="#fee-structure">Fee structure</a></h2>
<p>The processing costs on rollups [<a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-1">1</a> - <a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-6">6</a>] are  <a href="https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9">multi-dimensional</a>. The cost of processing a transaction on a Movement chain consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>execution</strong> fees: the costs that correspond to resources usage, CPU and permanent storage.</li>
<li><strong>data availability</strong> fees: the costs of publishing transactions/blocks data to a <em>data availability layer</em>.</li>
<li><strong>settlement</strong> fees: the costs of <em>validating</em> a transaction (e.g. zk-proof generation and verification, validators attestations.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall the transaction fees are defined by the sum of three types of fees:</p>
<p>$$ {ExecFees} + {DAFees} + {SetlFees}\mathpunct. $$</p>
<p>The fees should be expressed in a single (crypto)-currency, e.g. USD, or a token <code>$APT</code>, <code>$MOVE</code>, <code>$ETH</code>.</p>
<h3 id="execution"><a class="header" href="#execution">Execution</a></h3>
<h4 id="movevm-execution-fees"><a class="header" href="#movevm-execution-fees">MoveVM execution fees</a></h4>
<p>To execute a transaction and store the result, the operator of the chain uses some hardware: CPU and disk storage. The <strong>execution</strong> fees represent the compensation of the operator for executing a transaction.</p>
<p>Movement Network uses Aptos-Move as the execution layer and the execution fees for Aptos-Move are defined in the Aptos documentation <a href="https://aptos.dev/en/network/blockchain/gas-txn-fee">Gas and storage fees</a>.
The Aptos-Move fee mechanism splits the execution fees in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU and IO operations, expressed in gas units;</li>
<li>permanent storage, expressed in <code>$APT</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPU and IO operations for a transaction $tx$ result in a number of gas units $CpuIoGas(tx)$, and the corresponding fees are computing using a <em>gas price</em> $GasPrice$ expressed in the gas token (<code>$APT</code> for Aptos-Move). A transaction specifies the value $GasPrice(tx)$ it is willing to pay.<br />
The value $GasPrice(tx)$ must not be lower than a minimum $GasPrice$, which may fluctuate depending on network contention, and may be updated frequently (e.g. after each block).</p>
<p>In contrast, the permanent storage fees are designed to be stable and are updated infrequently. The reasoning is that they depend on how much storage costs (hardware, disks) and with advancement in technology this should go down in the future. The storage fees for $tx$ are denoted $StoreFees(tx)$ and expressed in <code>$APT</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The fees that correspond to the permanent storage are <strong>converted to gas units</strong> using the  $GasPrice$ and the <code>$APT</code> price.</p>
<p>The <em>total charge in gas units</em> for a transaction is the defined by:</p>
<p>$$ TotalGasUnits(tx) = CpuIoGas(tx) + StoreFees(tx)/GasPrice(tx)$$</p>
<p>and the total transaction fees are approximately<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">2</a></sup>:</p>
<p>$$ ExecFees(tx) = TotalGasUnits(tx) \times GasPrice(tx) \mathpunct.$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
We may not use the <code>$APT</code> token value to compute the fees on Movement. If we do so the $ExecFees$ will be identical to processing fees on Aptos-Move, and the total fees including $DAFees$ and $SetlFees$ will be higher than the processing fees on Aptos-Move, which may not be desirable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
<strong>Proposal 1</strong>: use the $TotalGasUnits(tx)$ and a $GasPrice$ in <code>$MOVE</code> to compute the execution fees on a Movement chain.
This may require an oracle to get the exchange rate for <code>$APT</code>/<code>$MOVE</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="gas-price-adjustments"><a class="header" href="#gas-price-adjustments">Gas price adjustments</a></h4>
<p>We may also want to adjust the $GasPrice$ (in <code>$MOVE</code>) to reflect our network load. There are many ways the $GasPrice$ can be updated. On Ethereum it is governed by rules in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559">EIP-1559</a>. zkSync, Arbitrum and OP Mainnet use different strategies [<a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-6">6</a>] to update the gas price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
<strong>Proposal 2</strong>: The OP Mainet [<a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-1">1</a>] strategy seems to be the simplest one so we may implement this strategy first.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="data-availability-fees"><a class="header" href="#data-availability-fees">Data Availability fees</a></h3>
<p>On a rollup (L2), transactions are grouped in <em>batches</em>. Processing a batch result in a new <em>state</em>. Both the transactions data and the new state are published to the <em>data availability</em> (DA) layer. The reason is that they should be available for third-parties to retrieve and verify the correctness of the state transitions (and blocks).</p>
<p>We assume that the agreement with the DA provider is such that we pay a <strong>fixed</strong> amount, $DAPerBytePrice$, in USD, per bytes we publish to the DA layer.
This can be updated infrequently e.g. every 6 months or year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
To reduce the costs, the data published to the DA layer can be compressed. This reduces the overall costs of publishing a batch (and a state) to the DA layer but makes it harder to identify the contribution of each transaction to the overall costs. OP Mainnet Ecotone has a <a href="https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees#formula">formula</a> to try and weight the contribution of each transaction to the compressed data. It is unclear how well it works in practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
<strong>Proposal 3</strong>: If the cost of publishing a batch $b$ to the DA is $DAFees(b)$, and $n$ transactions are in the batch, the DA fees for each transaction are $DAFees(b)/n$. This is simple to implement and can be refined later if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="settlement-fees"><a class="header" href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a></h3>
<p>The settlement fees depend on a number of factors, and on the settlement mechanism used by a given Move Stack chain.
There is a common feature though: some data are posted to Ethereum mainnet, and the price of a transaction on Mainnet may fluctuate.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that we charge our users when we process a transaction on a Move Stack chain. At that time we don’t know the price of an Ethereum transaction to post our data because it will happen in the future when the transaction is included in a block. As a result we may have to use an oracle to provide an estimate of the (gas) price on Ethereum when our transaction is processed.</p>
<p>Another thing that is common to all the settlement mechanisms is that we have to publish a <em>commitment</em> to the states/blocks we produce.
This is usually done by publishing <em>state roots</em> (hashes of states).
There are two interfaces to publish data on Ethereum:</p>
<ul>
<li>transaction data, and</li>
<li>blobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blobs were introduced to lower the cost of L2s and offer temporary (18 days) data storage at low cost.
Blobs are limited in size to 128KB, and a maximum of 6 blobs per (Ethereum) block.</p>
<h4 id="fraud-proof-settlement"><a class="header" href="#fraud-proof-settlement">Fraud-proof settlement</a></h4>
<p>For a fraud-proof settlement mechanism, we have to publish the <em>state roots</em> of the blocks we produce, or the change sets (they may be smaller).<br />
The size of the state roots of change sets roots is known when we create a (l2) block, so we can determine the expected cost of publishing to Ethereum mainnet using an oracle for the Ethereum gas price.</p>
<h4 id="validity-proof-settlement"><a class="header" href="#validity-proof-settlement">Validity proof settlement</a></h4>
<p>In a validity proof settlement we have two sources of costs:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <em>proving</em> part, which is a task dedicated to provers (or a market thereof),</li>
<li>the <em>verification</em> part which is a transaction in Ethereum Mainnet.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second part is usually predicatable as the sizes of proofs are known for each zk-proof system, and the verification step is <em>efficient</em>.
The proving part is more complex to evaluate. The <a href="https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/fee-mechanism">zkSync –– Fee mechanism</a> [<a href="Review/gas-fee-calculation/MIP/mip-16/index.html#ref-4">4</a>] may be a useful reference to design an equivalent mechanism for Movement chains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
Note that we first need a zkMoveVM to develop this approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="fast-finality-settlement"><a class="header" href="#fast-finality-settlement">Fast-finality settlement</a></h4>
<p>In our network, we will offer <em>fast-finality settlement</em> (FFS) where <em>validators</em> verify state transitions (and blocks) and interact with a contract, <code>StakingK</code>, that may live<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">3</a></sup> on Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>The costs incurred by the validators plus the cost of posting the attestations to Ethereum mainnet have to be factored in into the ${SetlFees}$.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
We have not finalised the FFS details yet so it may be premature to try and define fees for this mechanism. It also pertains to <em>staking</em> which is not fully fledged yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
<strong>Proposal 4</strong>: The simplest approach seems to implement a fraud-proof fee mechanism and publish state roots to Ethereum mainnet.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Proposal to establish two multisigs, one for engineers and another for the foundation, to facilitate the deployment and upgrade of the Movement Token (MOVEToken) and other upgradeable contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:primata@movementlabs.xyz">Primata</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-7"><a class="header" href="#abstract-7">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>MIP-18 advocates for the creation of two multisigs: one managed by Core Contributors engineers to propose contract upgrades and another managed by the Movement Foundation to execute them. This proposal enables testing of multisig services while ensuring secure and transparent upgrade processes for the Movement Token. The multisigs will be deployed on Ethereum, Sepolia, and Holesky (if available) networks.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-7"><a class="header" href="#motivation-7">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>There is an immediate need to deploy the Movement Token (MOVEToken) using a robust, secure, and auditable upgrade mechanism. By creating two multisigs—one for proposal and one for execution—we ensure a transparent and decentralized governance process over upgrades to critical contracts.</p>
<p>The first multisig allows Core Contributors engineers to propose upgrades via Safe’s multisig service. A remote key will automate the population of upgrade proposals. The second multisig, held by the Movement Foundation, will be responsible for executing the scheduled upgrades after a time delay, ensuring community trust and review.</p>
<p>Also, while developing an independent multisig, handling signature showed to be an issue that might be indicative of better letting signature to be handled by safe.global.</p>

<h3 id="multisig-setup"><a class="header" href="#multisig-setup">Multisig Setup</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Core Contributors Multisig</strong> (4/5 signatures required):</p>

<li>Role: Proposing upgrades.</li>
<li>Addresses: [redacted], sep:0x493516F6dB02c9b7f649E650c5de244646022Aa0.</li>
<li>Justification: We leave some wiggle room incase one of the engineers is away. We still need 3/4 engineers to sign.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Movement Foundation Multisig</strong> (3/5 signatures required, triggerable after 2-day timelock):</p>
<ul>
<li>Role: Executing upgrades.</li>
<li>Addresses: [redacted], sep:0x00db70A9e12537495C359581b7b3Bc3a69379A00.</li>

<ul>
<li>Role: Deploy contracts.</li>
<li>Addresses: [redacted].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both multisigs are part of a timelock mechanism to enforce a 2-day waiting period between the proposal and execution of upgrades. The engineers’ multisig schedules the upgrade, while the foundation multisig executes it after the timelock expires.</p>
<h3 id="workflow"><a class="header" href="#workflow">Workflow</a></h3>
<p><img src="Review/primata/mip-18/MIP/mip-18/workflow.png" alt="Workflow" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Contract Pipeline deploys a new contract implementation and generates transaction data for the upgrade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remote key automates the submission of a transaction proposal using SafeKit API’s <code>proposeTransaction</code>, populating the transaction for review by Core Contributors engineers.</li>
<li>The proposal includes the transaction for <code>timelock.schedule(proxyAdmin.upgradeAndCall(newContractImplementation))</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Core Contributors engineers review and gather 4/5 signatures to approve the proposal.</li>
<li>Once approved, the <code>timelock.schedule</code> transaction is enacted, holding the upgrade in a 2-day timelock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the timelock period, the Movement Foundation multisig gathers 3/5 signatures to execute the upgrade.</li>
<li>This triggers the <code>timelock.execute</code> transaction, allowing the upgrade to be applied to the ProxyAdmin, which will perform the contract upgrade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multisig-security-considerations"><a class="header" href="#multisig-security-considerations">Multisig Security Considerations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Believe it is best practice to rely on a service that is fully dedicated to multisigs. Eventual exploits found might open us up to exploits while safe.global could’ve prevent the exploit for us.</li>
<li>Having full control of our multisig deployments is dangerous and more engineering debt.</li>
<li>Having manual verification might stop us from automating a exploit that we did not notice.</li>
<li>Both multisigs serve as a dual signing authorities, ensuring a strict separation between proposing and executing transactions.</li>
<li>The timelock ensures a sufficient review window for all parties, with the ability for either multisig to cancel the transaction during the delay period.</li>
<li>Multisig can fully transition to a fully automated KMS setup once we have that in place. MOVE Token deployment did not follow all procedures, dependency contracts were deployed by an EOA.</li>
<li>Movement Foundation Safe will have ownership of Token Upgradeability - as far as I understood, please correct me if I’m wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reference-implementation-5"><a class="header" href="#reference-implementation-5">Reference Implementation</a></h2>
<p>The multisigs will be deployed using the Safe global multisig service, with contracts interacting through the SafeKit API. The remote key will automate transaction proposals for review by Core Contributors engineers.</p>
<h2 id="verification-6"><a class="header" href="#verification-6">Verification</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Correctness</strong>:<br />
This MIP follows the Safe multisig architecture, which has been extensively vetted in decentralized governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A remote key introduces automation but requires careful monitoring to prevent unauthorized transactions.</li>
<li>The separation of proposal and execution roles reduces the risk of unilateral decision-making.</li>
<li>If any of the keys part of each multisig are compromised, we must quickly remove it and substitute it with another key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Impacts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The additional timelock delay adds a slight performance lag but is necessary to enhance the security and transparency of upgrades.</li>
<li>Upgrades should not be periodic. This means that manual procedures might be more interesting than full automation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validation Procedures</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Safe multisig service and timelock mechanisms have been validated by various communities in the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>
<li>It’s not possible to fully automate this service because Movement Founadtion will always require the final signatures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer Review and Community Feedback</strong>:<br />
Current Governance proposals have indicated that we should have full automation and no access to signing keys. Currently we are a bit far from achieving full automation.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-8"><a class="header" href="#abstract-8">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The use of Movement’s fork of aptos core for the Movement Network is a subset of its total.  There are significant areas in this repository which are not used from a node, tooling and framework perspective.  Due to the size of the repository this MIP will only consider the redundancy inherited from the aptos framework.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-8"><a class="header" href="#motivation-8">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>With the Movement network only using a subset Movement’s fork of aptos core we are introducing technical debt and opening the framework to attack vectors for functionality not used in the context of Movement’s network fork.  Large areas of code can be removed to alleviate this issue and provide more security assurances</p>
<h2 id="specification-7"><a class="header" href="#specification-7">Specification</a></h2>
<p>With closer inspection of the Movement fork of aptos core we are able to quickly identify areas of functionality that are not required in the context of the Movement network.  The following would be modules which would be strong candidates to be removed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Proxy Aptos Framework signing for stage 0 of the Movement network governance</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:andy.bell@movementlabs.xyz">Andy Bell</a></li>
<li><strong>Desiderata</strong>: <a href="Review/andyjsbell/proxy-root/MIP/mip-25/../MD/md-0">MD-0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-9"><a class="header" href="#abstract-9">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This MIP describes a means by which during Stage 0 of the Movement network a signing key, single or multi, is able to manage the Aptos Framework without relying on the governance module included in the Aptos Framework.  This facilitating a more agile method in which Aptos Framework updates and modifications can be executed rapidly during this stage of the network.  This method would be deprecated in favour of decentralized governance in the future.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-9"><a class="header" href="#motivation-9">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>During Stage 0 of the Movement network Movement Labs would hold centralized control of the node and Aptos Framework.  In order to update or modify the Aptos Framework this would involve the deployment of new node binaries to operators in the network who would then upgrade.  One option to facilitate Aptos Framework upgrades is the use of the governance module which forms part of the Aptos Framework.  This, however, is not optimal for stage 0 of the network and the proposal here is to include a new module in the framework which proxies functions executed with the priviledges of the Aptos Framework.  Following a similiar strategy as the governance module but allowing voting to be circumvented with the use of a trusted multisig wallet held and managed by Movement Labs.</p>
<h2 id="specification-8"><a class="header" href="#specification-8">Specification</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The Proxy module MUST be made available as part of the Aptos Framework.</li>
<li>A single or multi-signature MUST be required to temporarily acquire the signing privileges of the Aptos Framework.</li>
<li>Only one authorized key MUST be able to operate the Proxy module and acquire the signing privileges.</li>
<li>The controller key MUST be rotated, and the Proxy module MUST provide functionality to support key rotation.</li>
<li>Updates to the framework MUST use a Move script signed by the controller account to acquire the signing privileges of the Aptos Framework during the script’s execution.</li>
<li>The controller account SHOULD be multisig, and this MUST be a strict requirement for the Proxy module. For testing purposes, this requirement MAY be relaxed to allow a single account.</li>
<li>The Proxy module MUST allow the controller to remove the signing capabilities and render the module inoperable.  This MUST allow an upgrade path to a new governance like module.  This MUST be an irreversible action.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create the Move script you want to execute.  An example can be found below.</li>
<li>With the hash of the script call <code>proxy::propose(execution_hash)</code> to initiate the request to proxy the script providing a refundable stake.  An off chain mechanism would track the newly created <code>proposal_id</code></li>
<li>The controller would call <code>proxy::approve(proposal_id)</code> which would approve the proposal</li>
<li>Alternatively the controller would call <code>proxy::reject(proposal_id)</code> to reject the proposal resulting in the return of the stake to the <code>creator</code></li>
<li>With a proposal being approved the proposed script can now be executed and will be delegated proxy, <code>proxy::delegate_to_proxy</code> to the signing capabilities of the Aptos Framework.</li>
<li>On receiving the proxy the proposal is removed with the stake being returned to the <code>creator</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust">script {
    use aptos_framework::proxy;
    use aptos_framework::atomic_bridge_configuration;

    // Called by anyone with an approved proposal id to be delegated proxy to the framework to 
    // update the bridge operator
    fun main(proposal_id: u64, new_operator: address) {
        let framework_signer = proxy::delegate_to_proxy(proposal_id);
        atomic_bridge_configuration::update_bridge_operator(&amp;framework_signer, new_operator);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Proposals</strong></p>
<p>Proposals expire 2 days after creation, after which they can no longer be approved or rejected. Only the creator of the proposal can remove it using the <code>remove(caller, proposal_id)</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>Key Rotation</strong></p>
<p>The controlling key can be rotated using <code>update_controller()</code> by providing the new controller’s public key along with a signed challenge, which proves ownership of the private key corresponding to the new public key.</p>
<p><strong>Genesis</strong></p>
<p>At Genesis, the <code>genesis.move</code> module is invoked to initialize a series of modules, including the <code>proxy</code> module. At this stage, the <code>core_resources_key</code> account would serve as the initial controller of the Proxy.</p>
<p>The following patch outlines an approach to side-load the proxy module alongside Aptos Governance, enabling a pathway for transitioning to Aptos Governance and deprecating the Proxy module after Genesis.</p>

Ideally, the <code>proxy</code> module would eventually be replaced by Aptos Governance. To facilitate this transition, the following Move script would deactivate the <code>proxy</code> module and transfer the <code>SignerCapability</code> from the proxy to Aptos Governance. This process can also be applied to upgrade to any other governance module if needed.</p>

<h3 id="1-correctness"><a class="header" href="#1-correctness">1. Correctness:</a></h3>
<p>The reference implementation has been integrated with the Aptos Framework. The <code>multisig_account.move</code> module has been verified as a mechanism to allow the proxy controller to be managed by a predefined set of signers. A review of <code>aptos_governance.move</code> provided a useful framework for validating and executing approved scripts based on their script hash. Further testing, including integration tests, will be conducted to validate the reference implementation presented here, and this will be supported by specification files for formal verification.</p>
<h3 id="2-security-implications"><a class="header" href="#2-security-implications">2. Security Implications:</a></h3>
<p>The controller’s ability to approve proposals that proxy the signing capabilities of the Aptos Framework introduces certain security risks. These risks are mitigated by ensuring that only the controller can approve or reject proposals. Additionally, cryptographic methods are employed to verify key rotations using a signed challenge, along with a nonce to prevent replay attacks. Malicious scripts are further safeguarded by validating their hash at the time of execution, ensuring that only approved scripts can be executed.
Changes will be required at Genesis to initialize the module, which will involve providing the <code>SignerCapability</code> to the module. A potential area of concern is the scope of control the proxy has during script execution. This could be addressed with more granular access control over the modules, but such a solution is beyond the scope of this MIP and would warrant its own proposal. Since this module is designed for upgrading the framework during Stage 0, it is expected to be superseded and made inoperative once the network transitions to a later stage of governance, potentially using Aptos Governance.</p>
<h3 id="3-performance-impacts"><a class="header" href="#3-performance-impacts">3. Performance Impacts:</a></h3>
<p>The proxy model offers an efficient way to govern the Aptos Framework through a multisig setup, bypassing the delays and staking requirements typically involved when using the Aptos Governance system.</p>

<p>Tests were conducted using Move scripts to confirm that they can successfully acquire the <code>SignerCapability</code> for the Aptos Framework. These tests were aligned with the existing capabilities provided by the Aptos Governance system.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Proposal to establish a structured pipeline for new contract deployments, aligning with the infrastructure outlined in MIP-23 while maintaining the existing Movement Token under MIP-18.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:primata@movementlabs.xyz">Primata</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-10"><a class="header" href="#abstract-10">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>MIP-27 proposes a Contract Pipeline that leverages a timelock-based infrastructure, ensuring security and decentralization for new contract deployments. While the Movement Token (MOVEToken) continues to operate under the provisions of MIP-18, future deployments should adhere to the structure set forth by MIP-23. The pipeline includes components such as a KMS multisig for transaction proposals, off-chain voting for stakers and token holders, and a timelock mechanism for executing transactions, providing transparency and decentralized control.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-10"><a class="header" href="#motivation-10">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Currently, Movement Token operates under the governance outlined in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/blob/primata/mip-2/MIP/mip-18/README.md">MIP-18</a>, and we may wish to maintain this setup for the time being. However, for future deployments and upgrades, we should transition to a more robust infrastructure which includes the release conventions as described in MIP-23. This approach provides decentralized control, security, and accountability through multisig setups, timelocks, and community voting mechanisms. By establishing a structured pipeline, we ensure that the development process remains transparent, auditable, and aligned with the community’s interests.</p>
<h2 id="specification-9"><a class="header" href="#specification-9">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The Contract Pipeline includes the following components:</p>
<h3 id="1-timelock"><a class="header" href="#1-timelock">1. <strong>Timelock</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: The timelock holds ownership of all upgradeable contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Ensures that contract upgrades are executed only after a specified delay, allowing time for review and potential cancellation by stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-kms-multisig-setup"><a class="header" href="#2-kms-multisig-setup">2. <strong>KMS Multisig Setup</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: Proposes transactions to the timelock.</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>1 KMS Key</strong>: Proposes transactions based on accepted tags.</li>
<li><strong>3 KMS Keys</strong>: Accept transactions only if the transaction hash is contained in a GitHub release.</li>
<li><strong>1 KMS Key</strong>: Schedules the timelock transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-off-chain-voting-mechanism"><a class="header" href="#3-off-chain-voting-mechanism">3. <strong>Off-Chain Voting Mechanism</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: Allows stakers and token holders to participate in “heat-checking” decisions, where off-chain voting provides feedback before finalizing transaction proposals.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Increases community involvement and allows for decentralized input into key governance decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-engineering-crew"><a class="header" href="#4-engineering-crew">4. <strong>Engineering Crew</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: The engineering team has the ability to push new contract versions for upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: The engineering team collaborates with the multisig setup to ensure proposed transactions align with the accepted development standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-mcr-domain"><a class="header" href="#5-mcr-domain">5. <strong>MCR Domain</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: This domain is composed of network stakers who can execute timelocked transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Provides an additional layer of decentralized control by allowing stakers to be responsible for executing transactions after the timelock period has elapsed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-contracts"><a class="header" href="#6-contracts">6. <strong>Contracts</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: The functional component of the protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Allow users to interact with Movement as a protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="workflow-for-releases"><a class="header" href="#workflow-for-releases">Workflow for Releases</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineers Push Releases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers push new releases containing the necessary deployment data and transaction details. Each release tag initializes the workflow.</li>
<li>Engineers release a new implementation contract on the network. The old contract is versioned and a new iterable contract is created. E.g. MOVEToken is deployed. It currently contains MOVETokenV1 (current implementation) and MOVEToken. ALL work is to be done on MOVEToken. Once a new upgrade occurs, the deployed MOVEToken version is renamed MOVETokenV2 and a new iterable contract is created and named MOVEToken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment JSON Files</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The release includes deployment JSON files following the standard proposed in MIP-23. These files include:
<ul>
<li>Broadcast data.</li>
<li>Transaction hash for signatures.</li>
<li>Bytecode reference.</li>
<li>Current deployment addresses.</li>
<li>Configuration details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These JSON files are the output generated by deployment scripts and provide the essential data for the release.</p>
<p>When a broadcast occurs using <a href="https://book.getfoundry.sh/">Foundry</a>, it generates a <strong>run file</strong> that captures all transactions and state changes made during the execution of a script. This run file can be extremely useful for tracing deployed contracts, transaction data, and any modifications to on-chain state. These run files serve as a key integration artifact and fallback data source, ensuring transparency and auditability. Following the <strong>Release Conventions</strong> specified in MIP-23, these run files should be included in each release to provide a complete trace of the deployment or upgrade process.</p>
<p>Once the implementation contract is deployed, a JSON file is generated under the path <code>protocol-units/settlement/mcr/contracts/script/helpers/upgrade/{contract}.json</code>. This file contains all the critical data required for the continuity of the upgrade process, including transaction details, contract addresses, and other metadata. The file is continuously updated during contract upgrades to reflect the latest data, making it a live reference document that tracks the state of the system over time.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
   "chainId": environmentChainId,
   "implementation": implementationAddress,
   "data": deploymentBytecode,
   "operation": Call || DelegateCall,
   "safeAddress": safeToPerformCall,
   "to": timeLockAddress,
   "value": ethValue
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, during deployments, the files <code>protocol-units/settlement/mcr/contracts/script/helpers/config.json</code> and <code>protocol-units/settlement/mcr/contracts/script/helpers/deployments.json</code> are used to store configuration data and reference previous deployments. These files are essential for ensuring consistency across deployments, as some contract deployments depend on the addresses or states of previously deployed contracts. Both files are considered live documents, updated during upgrades to maintain the most recent deployment and configuration data.</p>
<p>This structured approach ensures that the entire deployment and upgrade lifecycle is well-documented, traceable, and consistent with the release process, allowing for seamless integration and upgrades across the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GitHub Release</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deployment JSON files are bundled into a GitHub release, which serves as the source of truth for the multisig setup. The release verifies the transaction hash and other deployment details before initiating the next step in the workflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The KMS multisig, based on accepted GitHub release tags, proposes a transaction to the timelock. This is initiated by a KMS key responsible for proposing the transaction based on the tagged release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signatures</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three KMS keys approve the transaction if it matches the transaction hash contained in the GitHub release. These signatures are required to confirm the validity of the transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheduling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once consensus is reached, a separate KMS key schedules the timelock transaction. This step locks the transaction for a predefined period, allowing for review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voting and Heat Checking</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the timelock period, stakers and token holders participate in off-chain voting to provide feedback on the proposed transaction. This allows the community to give input before the final execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the timelock period, the MCR domain composed of network stakers is responsible for executing the transaction, completing the deployment or upgrade process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This combined workflow ensures transparency, security, and decentralized control over contract deployments and upgrades by integrating GitHub releases, KMS multisig, and timelock mechanisms with off-chain community feedback.</p>
<h2 id="reference-implementation-8"><a class="header" href="#reference-implementation-8">Reference Implementation</a></h2>
<p>The pipeline will leverage KMS multisig setups and GitHub releases as a mechanism for secure and auditable transaction proposals. Off-chain voting mechanisms for stakers and token holders can be implemented using existing decentralized governance platforms.</p>

<p>Fast-Finality Settlement (FFS) is a mechanism that allows for fast <em>confirmation</em> of transactions backed by crypto-economic security. This MIP outlines the high-level specifications and architecture of FFS.</p>

<p>Layer 2s (L2), including rollups, publish or secure transaction data in a data availability (DA) layer or at Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1, L1). Validity and optimistic rollups can finalize (confirm) transactions within approximately 30 minutes, resp. ~1 week. Until a transaction is finalized, there is no assurance about its validity and result (success or failure). This can be a limiting factor for certain types of DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Our objective is to enable transaction issuers to quickly get some guarantees that their transactions are correctly included in a block. The crypto-economic security is provided by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol.</p>
<p>The mechanism can be deployed independently for a chain, or used in combination with existing settlement mechanisms, such as ZK and optimistic settlements.</p>
<p>As a result, users can rely and trust the <strong>L2-confirmation</strong> (sometimes also described as L2-finality) to use as confirmation, or if the chain is configured to do so, wait for <strong>L1-finality</strong>, such as end of challenge window for fraud proofs (optimistic L2) or verification of a ZK-proof (validity L2).</p>

A more detailed description of a (partial) implementation of the mechanism is available at <a href="https://blog.movementlabs.xyz/article/postconfirmations-L2s-rollups-blockchain-movement">this blog post on postconfirmations</a>.</p>
<p>This MIP provides an overview of an architecture of FFS, and its main components.</p>
<h2 id="specification-11"><a class="header" href="#specification-11">Specification</a></h2>
<h3 id="overview-3"><a class="header" href="#overview-3">Overview</a></h3>
<p><strong>FFS</strong>. The objective of Fast Finality Settlement (FFS) is to confirm that transactions are <em>processed</em> correctly and that the node has <em>read</em> the transactions in the correct order. It does not impact the already established order of transactions by the sequencer.</p>
<p>At an abstract level, the L2-blockchain increases by a new block in each (L2) round, and this block is the successor of the block in the previous round, the <em>predecessor</em>. Initially, there is a <em>genesis</em> block with no predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>Sequencer-Batch</strong>. Each round corresponds to the processing of a <em>sequencer-batch</em> of transactions which is proposed by the <em>sequencer</em> (can be centralized, decentralized, shared).</p>
<p><strong>L2-Block</strong>. For the vast majority of cases we mean L2-blocks, thus we will omit the “L2-” prefix, i.e. by <em>block</em> we mean L2-block. A node with execution capability is in charge of validating the transactions in a sequencer-batch and calculate the new state. Since the sequencer-batches are provided by the sequencer, the new state and the state roots for a block are deterministic. For a sequencer-batch $b$ the state is $S_b$ and the state root is $H(S_b)$. From the sequencer-batch $b$ and the state $S_b$ the block $B$ is computed (which contains the information of the sequencer-batch and the state root).</p>
<p><strong>Block-range</strong>. L2-Blocks can be constructed and confirmed on L2 at a higher rate than is feasible for L1. We group L2-blocks into a <em>block-range</em> that is confirmed together.</p>
<p><strong>Local validation</strong>. Since a block is deterministically calculated we say a block (and the associated new state) is <em>validated locally</em> once the execution engine calculates it from the sequencer-batch.</p>
<p>The validity judgement to be made is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Given a block $B$ (predecessor), a sequencer-batch of transactions $txs$ and a successor block $B’$, is $B’$ the^[the MoveVM is deterministic and there can be only valid successor.] <em>correct</em> successor of $B$ after executing the sequence of transactions $txs$?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>correct</em> means that the successor block $B’$ (and the state it represents) has been computed in accordance with the semantics of the MoveVM, which we denote  $B \xrightarrow{\ txs \ } B’$.</p>
<p><strong>Validator</strong>. A node that is responsible for validating transactions and confirming L2-blocks. To guarantee the validity of a new block $B’$, we use a set of <em>validators</em> who are in charge of verifying the transition $B \xrightarrow{\ txs \ } B’$.</p>
<p><strong>Attestation</strong>. A validator <em>attests</em> for a new block $B’$. This can be done, for example, by casting a vote :white_check_mark: (true) or :x: (false) for a proposal by a leader validator. Or by each validator sending the hash of the block they have validated.</p>
<p><strong>L2-confirmation certificate</strong>. When enough validators have attested for a new block $B’$, the block is <em>L2-confirmed</em> (sometimes referred to as <em>L2-final</em>). The accumulation of enough votes is aggregated in an L2-confirmation certificate. A naive implementation of the L2-confirmation certificate is a list of votes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Until a better definition arises we consider <em><strong>confirmation</strong></em> to be defined as <em>L2-finality</em> (i.e. <em>L2-confirmation</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>L2-confirmation</strong>. FFS aims to <em>confirm</em> the validity of each produced L2-block, at every L2-block height.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
If we confirm each successor block before adding it to the (confirmed) L2-chain, there cannot be any fork, except if the sequencer would provide equivocating sequencer-batches for a given height AND there is a sufficiently strong Byzantine attack on the confirmation process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the validators can attest blocks quickly and make their attestations available to third-parties, we have a fast confirmation mechanism supported by crypto-economic security, the  level of which depends on what is at stake for the confirmation of a block.</p>
<p><strong>Postconfirmation</strong>. At certain intervals confirmation will also be achieved on L1. The L1 contract will verify the satisfaction of the super-majority criteria. This provides an L1-protected <em>postconfirmation</em> that the block (or a batch of blocks, which we call <em>block range</em>) is confirmed. This additional anchoring mechanism increases the security of the L2-confirmation as it locks in the L2-confirmation, reduces the risk of long range attacks and provides a way to slash validators that have attested for invalid blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Slashing</strong>. The security of the mechanism relies on a PoS protocol. Each validator has to stake some assets, and if they are malicious they <em>should</em> be slashed.
The condition for slashing may be met by several quiteria, and not all slashing conditions may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>equivocate (send a different vote to different validators or users)</li>
<li>vote :white_check_mark: for an invalid block</li>
<li>vote :x: for a valid block</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-challenges"><a class="header" href="#main-challenges">Main challenges</a></h3>
<p>To achieve crypto-economically secured fast finality, we need to solve the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>design a <em>staking</em> mechanism for the validators to stake assets, distribute rewards and manage slashing</li>
<li><em>define and verify</em> the threshold (e.g. 2/3 of validators attest :white_check_mark:) for L2-confirmation</li>
<li><em>communicate</em> the L2-confirmation status.</li>
</ol>

<p>The staking mechanism is implemented in a contract on L1.
This contract provides the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>join: a new validator can join the set of validators by staking some assets</li>
<li>exit: a validator exits and  get their stakes back</li>
<li>vote: receive a vote or a set of votes, verify the integrity of the votes (signatures) and the minimum threshold (e.g. 2/3)</li>

<p>To ensure that the L2-confirmation status is made available to third-parties, we may publish our <em>proof</em>  (2/3 of attestations :white_check_mark:) to a data availability layer and get a <em>certificate</em> that the proof is available.<br />
This DA layer should offer a reliable <em>mempool</em> for example as described <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827">in this paper</a>.</p>

<p>The L1 contract will verify the L2-confirmation certificate. If the certificate is correct the block (or sequence of blocks) are <em>postconfirmed</em>. This requires handling who should send the certificate to the L1 contract, and how to verify the certificate.</p>
<h2 id="reference-implementation-10"><a class="header" href="#reference-implementation-10">Reference Implementation</a></h2>
<p>To simplify we assume that each validator stakes the same amount.
The set of validators is in charge of validating sequenced batches and producing blocks that also commit to the state root of the sequenced batch.</p>
<p>There may be different protocols for the postconfirmation and the L2-confirmation. Version A and version B address Postconfirmation. Version C includes L2-confirmation.</p>
<h4 id="version-a-postconfirmation-with-leader-dependent-blocks"><a class="header" href="#version-a-postconfirmation-with-leader-dependent-blocks">Version A: Postconfirmation with leader-dependent blocks</a></h4>
<p>A leader validator is elected for a certain interval. The leader proposes the next transition (block-range $B_r’$):  $B_r \xrightarrow{\ txs \ } B_r’$. The leader can do so by sending a digest of $txs$ (Merkle root) and a digest of $B_r’$ (Merkle root hash of $B_r’$), or a <em>change set</em>. The leader commits on L1 to $B_r’$. Every validator checks the validity of $B_r’$ and prepares a vote message (:white_check_mark: or :x:).</p>
<p><strong>Direct L1 commitments</strong>. The vote messages of each validator are directly sent to the L1 contract. Once enough votes are available on L1, the leader initiates the postconfirmation process.</p>
<p><strong>Leader collects votes</strong>. The vote messages of each validator are directly sent to the L1 contract. Once the votes reach the required threshold :white_check_mark: for $B_r’$, the leader initiates the postconfirmation process with the proof of the votes.</p>

<h4 id="version-b-postconfirmation-with-deterministic-blocks"><a class="header" href="#version-b-postconfirmation-with-deterministic-blocks">Version B: Postconfirmation with deterministic blocks</a></h4>
<p>Blocks are deterministically derived from the sequencer-batch, and consequently the block-range $B_r’$ is deterministic. This is in contrast to Version A, where a leader proposes the next transition.Validators then attest for the next transition directly:  $B_r \xrightarrow{\ txs \ } B_r’$. E.g. by commiting to the the hash of $B_r’$.</p>
<p>An additional actor - the <code>acceptor</code> - is introduced that initiates the postconfirmation process. This is necessary, as this step requires additional gas costs on L1 and thus this role requires additional rewards. The <code>acceptor</code> serves for a specified period and is then replaced by another validator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Since the block derivation is deterministic, $f+1$ may be sufficient to confirm the block. (However, we require $2f+1$ to cover potential edge cases, such as that the sequencer cannot be trusted.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Direct L1 commitments</strong>. In the scenario where validators commit individually they send the block hashes of the calculated blocks directly to the L1 contract.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptor collects commitments</strong>. In a more optimised scenario, the acceptor sends the super-majority proof to the L1 contract.</p>

<p>This approach extends Version B.</p>
<p>A p2p layer is established between validators. Validators communicate to aggregate a threshold of votes on each deterministically determined L2-block. This provides L2-confirmations in the order of seconds.</p>
<p>Since this approach already collects commitments off-L1, the natural choice is to use Version B where the acceptor collects the commitments and sends the super-majority proof to the L1 contract. This provides postconfirmations in the order of minutes.</p>

<h3 id="correctness-and-security"><a class="header" href="#correctness-and-security">Correctness and Security</a></h3>
<p>A more detailed discussion on the correctness and security is discussed in <a href="https://blog.movementlabs.xyz/article/security-and-fast-finality-settlement">this blog post on FFS</a>.</p>
<p>The level of security depends on the total stake of the L2 validators. The higher the more secure.</p>
<p>The correctness of the mechanism relies on a few trust assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Byzantine assumption</strong>.
We assume that at most $f$ of the total $n=3f+1$ (L2) validators can be malicious.
This implies that if more than $2f +1$ attest :white_check_mark: for a new block, at least $f + 1$ honest validators have attested :white_check_mark:, so at least one honest validator has :white_check_mark: $B’$ and $B’$ is valid. Thus, we request that &gt;$\frac{2}{3}n$ (super-majority)  validators have :white_check_mark: $B’$ to validate $B’$.</p>
<p><strong>Postconfirmations</strong>. We assume that the contract that validates the proof of super-majority is correct (there are no bugs in the implementation of the contract). As a result, when the staking contract verification step is confirmed on L1 (L1-finality), the super-majority proof verification is L1-secure.</p>
<p>Combining the two results above we have: confirmation (L1 contract) that &gt;2/3 of validators have attested :white_check_mark: and if &gt;2/3 have attested :white_check_mark: then $B’$ is valid. So overall, if the &gt;2/3 super-majority is verified by the staking contract, $B’$ is valid.</p>
<p><strong>L2-confirmation</strong> The L2 validators also publish the proofs to a DA layer and once the proof is available it cannot be tampered with. Thus, we can provide some guarantees about the irreversibility of transactions when the availability certificate (of the L2-confirmation certificate) is delivered, and before the actual proof is verified on L1. If validators misbehave, they <em>will</em> be slashed on L1, which provides strong incentives for validators not to act malicious.</p>
<p>This is conditional to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that the validators send the same proof to the L1 staking contract and to the DA.</li>
<li>validators cannot exit too early (not before the proof they are committed to are confirmed on L1).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance"><a class="header" href="#performance">Performance</a></h3>
<p>There are several aspects that can impact performance and should be properly addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>time to collect the super-majority votes</li>
<li>time to get an availability certificate for the super-majority proof</li>
<li>number and size of messages and transactions, specifically containing the signatures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-plan-and-implementation"><a class="header" href="#detailed-plan-and-implementation">Detailed plan and implementation</a></h2>
<p>A detailed plan should be proposed addressing the implementation of the different components, and ideally MIPs to capture the requirements for each component.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>validators network</strong>: how they communicate and build the <em>super-majority proof</em>.</li>
<li><strong>L2-confirmation</strong>: communication of the super-majority proof to the DA. Validators should certificate in the order of seconds to provide confirmation guarantees in the order of seconds.</li>
<li><strong>postconfirmation</strong>: L1 validation contract, how it verifies the super-majority proof and if and how there is interaction with the DA layer.</li>
<li><strong>staking</strong>: what crypto-coin is used for staking, safeguards to prevent validators from exiting too early etc</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optimizations"><a class="header" href="#optimizations">Optimizations</a></h2>
<p>There are several aspects that could be optimized and refined:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>super-majority proof</strong>: it can be a list of votes, but could also be a zk-proof (more compact). The suer-majority proof is not a proof of correct execution (as in zkVM) but simply of super-majority and this is cheaper to compute.</li>
<li><strong>signatures aggregation</strong>: we want to avoid sending large transactions to the L1 as it increases operational costs. How to aggregate signatures to send more compact messages/transactions?</li>
<li><strong>delegation/weighted stakes</strong>: a mechanism for validators to delegate their voting power to other validators. Ability for validators to stake different amounts (and use weighted stakes super-majority).</li>
<li><strong>commit to a sequence of L2-blocks</strong>. The L2-confirmation certificate could be per block. However, on L1 we may want to commit to a sequence of blocks. This can be done by committing to the state root of the last block in the sequence or more complicated approaches using Merkle roots.</li>
<li><strong>involvement of DA layer</strong>. Validators sent their votes or commitments to a DA layer off-L1. This ensures that votes remain available and can be used for potential slashing. This step should take O(1) second if we use a fast reliable mempool.</li>

<h2 id="abstract-13"><a class="header" href="#abstract-13">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This MIP introduces the architectural guide for implementing <em><strong>NB-FFS Decoupled</strong></em>, a means of using the Native Bridge and Fast-finality Settlement with a fixed supply of token. This decoupled approach relies on burning gas on the L2 into an L2 pool and issuing rewards in an LP token on the L1. Details of the L2 pool recirculation and the L1 LP token issuance are largely left to follow-on MIPs, however we do specify general constraints and guidelines.</p>
<p>We also propose the usage of intermediary tokens for bridging to fully decouple the L1 and L2 systems. This allows for the L2 pool to be recirculated without the need for a direct bridge to the L1 and exposure to fallibility of the bridge on either side.</p>
<p>Without the usage of intermediary tokens, we refer to this system as <em><strong>NB-FFS Partially Decoupled</strong></em>, for which we do not intend a separate MIP.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-13"><a class="header" href="#motivation-13">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> system is intended to address <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a>. That is, <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> provides a means for using the Native Bridge and Fast-finality Settlement with a fixed supply of token.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> contends with the fallibility of the Native Bridge by (a) removing any need for its involvement in returning funds to the L1 and (b) using intermediary tokens to avoid any locking, minting, burning, or other operations that would potentially modify the total supply of either the L1 staking token or the L2 staking token.</p>
<p><em>NB-FFS Partially Decoupled</em> still removes the need for the Native Bridge to return funds to the L1, but does not protect the total supply from all bridge failures. Hence <em>NB-FFS Partially Decoupled</em> is not a sound solution for <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/./ab-ffs-decoupled.png" alt="NB-FFS Decoupled" /></p>
<p>An <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> system is defined by the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The L1 staking token MUST be a unique token issued in a fixed supply.</li>
<li>The L2 gas token MUST be a unique token issued in a fixed supply.</li>
<li>Rewards issued via FFS MUST NOT be issued in the L1 staking token, but instead in an LP token on the L1.</li>
<li>The LP Token MAY elect to maintain a supply or value correlated with the L1 staking token or the L2 gas token. But, this supply or value correlation MUST NOT rely on special capabilities of the LP token or trusted third parties.</li>
<li>The L2 staking token MUST be burned on the L2 to deposit gas into an L2 pool.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the LP Token supply is not fixed, the NB-FFS solution implemented is referred to as <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> Demurrage. <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a> provides a more complete specification for <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> Demurrage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the NB-FFS solution implemented implemented is referred to as <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> Grant. <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a> provides a more complete specification for <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> Grant.</p>
<h3 id="l1-lp-token"><a class="header" href="#l1-lp-token">L1 LP Token</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The L1 LP Token MUST NOT enshrine any special capabilities to mint or otherwise unlock the L1 staking token. That is, the L1 LP token must be independent of the L1 staking token and only effectively be used to purchase the L1 staking token.</li>
<li>The governing system MAY provide vouchers or other means of redeeming the L1 LP token for the L1 staking token from a dedicate allocation. The object of these vouchers SHOULD be to peg the value of the L1 LP token to the L1 staking token.</li>
</ol>
<p>A more complete proposal for the usage L1 LP tokens with FFS is provided in <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a>.</p>

<li>Burning gas an amount of gas $\alpha$ on the L2 MUST result in depositing that same amount of gas $\alpha$ into an L2 pool.</li>
<li>The L2 pool MUST be recirculated to the L2 users in a manner that is not specified in this MIP. Generally, this means the L2 pool must either be used to issue rewards or otherwise be a reliable means of purchasing gas token on the L2.</li>
</ol>
<p>A system adhering to these requirements is referred to as a Gas Pool. A more complete proposal for the usage of Gas Pools is provided in <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a> requests provisions for genesis for any system addressing its desiderata. The genesis for <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> is not fully specified in this MIP and such full specification is provided under <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a>. However, generally, there are two strategies for genesis:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Separate Mints</strong>: mint the L1 staking token and the L2 gas token simultaneously in fixed supplies amounting to the intended total supply.</li>
<li><strong>Genesis Bridge Transfer</strong>: mint the L1 staking or L2 gas token in a fixed supply and transfer the other token from the L1 to the L2 s.t. a successful bridge transfer occurs before the system is operational.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="on-the-nature-of-the-tokens"><a class="header" href="#on-the-nature-of-the-tokens">On the Nature of the Tokens</a></h3>
<p>Fundamentally, the L1 staking and L2 gas token in an <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> system are independent, i.e., not constituting a representation of the same token redeemable on different chains. The comprise two closed token systems where assets cannot be lost or gained.</p>
<p>The usage of <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> is then suitable for systems wherein the governing body wishes to prioritize the security of the total supply of the staking tokens. To the extent the governing body wishes for the economics of the L1 staking token and L2 gas token to remain correlated, the governing body shall make efforts to peg the value of the L1 LP token to the L1 staking token.</p>
<p>In the case that <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> Grant is implemented, FFS shall require a new token generation event at some point determined by the size of the grant. Thus, FFS has a lifespan w.r.t. to the L1 staking token. This lifespan is further detailed in <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a>.</p>
<p>In the case that <em>NB-FFS Decoupled</em> Demurrage is implemented, the value of L1 LP Token shall tend to zero over time. This may also be remedies by new token generation events. This phenomenon is further detailed in <a href="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-decoupled/MIP/mip-40/todo">MIP-n</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-14"><a class="header" href="#abstract-14">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>We propose a governed gas pool both as provisional and potentially permanent solution to the supply problem described in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a>. This solution consists of depositing funds into a pool on the L2, and holding votes against actions for the recirculation of said funds.</p>
<p>The concept of a governed gas pool can be applied generally to manage migrations between systems. For example, the governed gas pool could be used to transition from the “Trickle-back” mechanism referenced in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a> to <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/42">MIP-42</a>, as is used as an example amongst others herein.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-14"><a class="header" href="#motivation-14">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The NB-FFS under fixed supply presents several challenges presented in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a>. This MIP seeks to address the question of where used gas funds should be deposited with a simple and flexible solution. By simply depositing funds into a pool and holding votes against actions for the recirculation of said funds, we can create a system that can provide a short-term solution to the supply problem and generalize to other systems.</p>
<h2 id="specification-13"><a class="header" href="#specification-13">Specification</a></h2>
<p><img src="Review/l-monninger/ab-ffs-governed-gas-pool/MIP/mip-44/governed-gas-pool.png" alt="Governed Gas Pool" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Gas used on the L2 MUST be deposited into the Governed Gas Pool.</li>
<li>The Governed Gas Pool MUST disperse deposited funds according to a proposal made by Proposers which is enacted by a vote of Executors.</li>
<li>The Governed Gas Pool SHOULD define a maximum emissions rate for the pool s.t. the governing body cannot engage in Byzantine or other malicious behavior.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="proposers-and-executors"><a class="header" href="#proposers-and-executors">Proposers and Executors</a></h3>
<p>The Governed Gas Pool will have two roles: Proposers and Executors. Proposers will be able to propose actions for the pool, and Executors will be able to vote on these actions.</p>
<p>The rationale behind these two separate roles is to encapsulate the decision-making process. This separation of concerns can allow off-chain services which are less-secure to propose actions which do not immediately affect the pool. Executors, who are more secure, can then vote on these actions.</p>
<h3 id="actions"><a class="header" href="#actions">Actions</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For simplicity, we suggest that all synchronous and atomic actions performed by the pool SHOULD be formulated as dispersals from the pool into other accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For security, we propose the constraint that all of these dispersals SHOULD be $O(1)$.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the pool can securely–without risk of gas attack–disperse into <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/42">MIP-42</a> withholdings if said action only involves depositing funds into the account controlling that account. In the case that this action were linear in the size of the approved liquidity providers, for example, gas pool proposals good be subject to gas attacks which would prevent critical actions for recirculating funds to take place at the appropriate time.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When considering mechanisms which are not synchronous and atomic, we propose that the Governed Gas Pool SHOULD only be considered responsible for the security of the synchronous and atomic step constituting the initial dispersal.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the “Trickle-back” mechanism referenced in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/38">MD-38</a> could be performed with an initial dispersal into the bridge pool. However, the ultimate effect of those funds returning to L1 settlement rewards would not be guaranteed once set dispersal occurs. Thus, when analyzing the security of the “Trickle-back” mechanism, one would consider the actions of the Governed Gas Pool as secure insofar as the dispersal into the bridge pool is secure. The remainder of the mechanism would be considered separately.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-15"><a class="header" href="#abstract-15">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The Native Bridge design presented in <a href="Review/mip/security_falliblity/MIP/mip-46/../mip-39/">MIP-39</a> has the following assumptions to achieve secure operation, and which we detail in <a href="Review/mip/security_falliblity/MIP/mip-46/index.html#motivation">Motivation</a>.</p>
<p>Given that these hold, the sum of the circulating token supply of <code>$L1MOVE</code> and <code>$L2MOVE</code> is equal to <code>MOVE_MAX</code>. To improve the security of the relayer and protect the total token supply against violations of the above assumptions, we propose several safety mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>The token supply of <code>$L1MOVE</code>, as well as <code>$L2MOVE</code> cannot exceed the total supply individually.</li>
<li>The total amount of bridge transfers is rate limited.</li>
<li>The relayer shall maximize security measurements to protect its keys.</li>
<li>Transfer amount has a min and max amount.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="motivation-15"><a class="header" href="#motivation-15">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Two security assumptions underpin the secure operation of the bridge.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Liveness of the relayer</strong>. It is assumed that the relayer is active within some time Delta. For further details on this we refer to <a href="Review/mip/security_falliblity/MIP/mip-46/../mip-39/">MIP-39</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure relayer</strong>. It is assumed that the relayer keys are operated securely. More specifically we require that the key access and the signing process of the relayer is not compromised. For example the keys could get compromised if a malicious entity could get access to the key(s). In the basic design, see <a href="Review/mip/security_falliblity/MIP/mip-46/???">MIP-????</a>, the relayer has the capability to mint <code>$L2MOVE</code> tokens, thus could increase the total supply if compromised.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To increase the the reliability and security of the Native Bridge design, measures to improve the above assumptions are proposed.</p>
<h2 id="specification-14"><a class="header" href="#specification-14">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<h5 id="1-fix-the-potential-supply"><a class="header" href="#1-fix-the-potential-supply">1. Fix the Potential Supply</a></h5>
<p>As described in the <a href="Review/mip/security_falliblity/MIP/mip-46/index.html#abstract">Abstract</a>, the sum of the token supply of <code>$L1MOVE</code> and <code>$L2MOVE</code> is equal to <code>MOVE_MAX</code>. Since the bridge is the sole point of creation (or release) of <code>$L2MOVE</code> token, the L2 contract MUST monitor the <code>$L2MOVE</code> supply. The L2 bridge contract MUST not release more <code>$L2MOVE</code> than the maximum supply <code>MOVE_MAX</code>.</p>
<h5 id="2-native-bridge-rate-limitation"><a class="header" href="#2-native-bridge-rate-limitation">2. Native Bridge rate limitation</a></h5>
<p>The total amount of bridge transfers should be rate limited to $(X, T)$ where $X$ is the maximum transferable amount per time period $T$. I.e. the bridge should not allow more than $X$ total transaction value in any $T$ period.</p>
<p>To not impact honest traffic heavily, a governance body MAY be overseeing, whether the <code>bridge_rate</code> SHOULD be increased temporarily and for what interval. However, such a mechanism impacts the security assumptions as this governance body also would have to adhere to stringent security requirements and a compromise of the governance body could effectively disable the rate limitation. Also the above mentioned Crypto-economic security guarantees do not hold any longer.</p>
<h5 id="3-relayer-key-protection"><a class="header" href="#3-relayer-key-protection">3. Relayer key protection</a></h5>
<p>The relayer shall maximize security measurements to protect its keys. For example, it SHOULD implement a multi-signature scheme to sign its messages, as is proposed in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/21">MIP-21</a>. The owners of the constituent keys should be distinct entities with distinct access to their keys.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@j2abro/a-visual-guide-to-blockchain-bridge-security-e982fec671a7">This article</a> describes some of the considerations that have to be taken into account:</p>
<p><strong>Multisigs</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s likely that the bridge is controlled by one or more multisigs —wallets that require multiple individuals to sign before a transaction is executed. Multisigs add an element of security by ensuring that a single signer can’t control the bridge. Multisigs might be used to enable the bridge contracts to be upgraded or paused. While multisigs are an essential security control for bridges, they are not foolproof and require proper management. In fact multisigs have been targeted in some major bridge exploits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Contract Exploits</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multisigs are implemented as smart contracts and are thus potentially vulnerable to exploits. Many of the popular multisig contracts have been used to store billions in assets over time and are somewhat battle tested. Nonetheless, these contracts do represent additional attack surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Signers are People</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multisigs are controlled by a group of signers; you must trust that the private keys of those signers are kept secure. Any individual that is a singer on a multisig must be trusted to not be an adversary of course, but also must be trusted to adhere to basic security practices. Multisig signers are ripe targets for phishing and malware attacks.</p>

<h5 id="1-fix-the-potential-supply-1"><a class="header" href="#1-fix-the-potential-supply-1">1. Fix the Potential Supply</a></h5>
<p>Since the maximal released supply of <code>$L1MOVE</code> is <code>MOVE_MAX</code> the maximum <em>Potential Supply</em> (of the sum of the supply of <code>$L1MOVE</code> and <code>$L2MOVE</code>) is 2 $\times$ <code>MOVE_MAX</code>, even in the case of a compromised relayer and a maximum exploit.</p>
<h5 id="2-native-bridge-rate-limitation-1"><a class="header" href="#2-native-bridge-rate-limitation-1">2. Native Bridge rate limitation</a></h5>
<p>Eigenlayer AVS does suggest a similar model and provides the following Definition on Strong Economic Security in their <a href="https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/assets/files/EIGEN_Token_Whitepaper-0df8e17b7efa052fd2a22e1ade9c6f69.pdf">white paper (EIGEN: The Universal Intersubjective Work Token)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Formal Definition of Strong Cryptoeconomic Security</em>
If [a bridge] acquires more [cryptoeconomic] security than the harm it can suffer from an attack within the interval $T_{redeem}$ slots, then it achieves strong cryptoeconomic security, i.e.<br>
        <em>[Economic]-security ≥ Harm-from-corruption [..] in $T_{redeem}$ slots</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[..] consider a [..] bridge [..] for a rollup, which has a $(X, T)$-rate-limit [..]. Now if [$T&lt;T_{redeem}$,] the total value transacted by the bridge is less than $X$ during any attack period, and therefore the harm from corruption for the $T$ period is less than or equal to $X$. If the [cryptoeconomic] security is greater than X then this [bridge] works correctly. [..] we have the following conditions for strong cryptoeconomic safety.</p>

<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:richard@movementlabs.xyz">Richard Melkonian</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-17"><a class="header" href="#abstract-17">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The Goverened Gas Pool design presented in <a href="Review/0xmovses/aptos-gov-pool/MIP/mip-48/../mip-44/">MIP-44</a> is required to be subject to onchain governance by a governing body that holds the
<code>$L2-MOVE</code> token. In [MIP-44] governance mechanisms and roles are proposed, such as <code>Proposers</code> and <code>Executors</code> so that the collected gas can be used
for the good of the network.</p>
<p>The Governed Gas Pool may be used to provide liquidity for different network needs, such as L1 Reward Tokens, or to enable the “Trickle-back”, where the <code>$L2-MOVE</code> would be paid
directly to attestors as <code>$L1-MOVE</code> for rewards. For all these activities a dispersal of funds is required, this MIP proposes concrete ways to manage dispersal events
in a safe immutable and secure manner.</p>
<p>To decide on how acrued <code>$L2-MOVE</code> in the Governed Gas Pool should be used, a robust and thorough implementation of governance should be proposed.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-17"><a class="header" href="#motivation-17">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>This MIP proposes an implementation of the governance mechanism proposed in [MIP-44] by using the <code>aptos_governance.move</code> module. We think this has several benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>aptos_governance.move</code> is fully audited and battle tested.</li>
<li><code>aptos_governance.move</code> is currently in use on the Aptos Blockchain.</li>
<li>Using aptos governance prepares us for extendeding it and using it for future proposals to upgrade or migrate the network, this will be a fairly common necessity post-mainnet.</li>
<li>It strenghtens the utility of <code>$L2-MOVE</code> as this becomes the governance token.</li>

<p>In response to <a href="Review/l-monninger/just-reward/MIP/mip-49/../MD/md-n/README.html">MD-49</a>, we propose a fee model for an NB-FFS L2 system which interprets all fees as compensated for in gas fees, bridge fees, or FFS rewards which are adjusted by a governing body. We argue that this approach avoids many of the security and fairness issues that arise in more complex fee models, and is analogous to fee models used in traditional L1 systems. We provide an account of the complexity of other fee models and the limitations from which even theses models suffer. We exemplify these limitations by describing an NB-FFS system which uses Celestia as DA and Ethereum as the Settlement Layer.</p>

<p>An NB-FFS <strong>Governed Reward system</strong> will meet the following requirements for fees:</p>
<ol>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Reward system SHALL idenitfy to whom fees may be charged: L2 clients, Operator</li>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Reward system MUST provide a means for the governing body to adjust the gas fees charged to L2 clients according to a vote. This is intended to ensure that the cost of using the L2 system is competitive with other systems.</li>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Reward system MUST provide a means for the governing body to adjust the fees charged to bridge clients according to a vote. This is intended to ensure that the cost of using the bridge service is competitive with other systems.</li>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Reward system MUST transfer gas fees into a <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pulls">Governed Gas Pool</a> which SHALL be used to add additional rewards to the FFS rewards pool when needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>An NB-FFS <strong>Governed Reward system</strong> will meet the following requirements for rewards</p>
<ol>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Rewards system SHALL idenitfy 3 operators to whom fees rewards may be paid: validators, delegators, and bridge operators.</li>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Rewards system MUST provide a means for the governing body, e.g., Movement Labs to adjust FFS reward parameters according to a vote. This is intended to ensure the value of the FFS rewards exceeds difficult to compute costs of operating as a participant in the L2 system.</li>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Rewards system SHALL compensate validators as a function of expected settlement and DA costs with FFS rewards, but does not need to recompute this expectations.</li>
<li>An NB-FFS Governed Rewards system SHALL compensate bridge operators with collected gas fees, but does not need to recompute these fees.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="costs-and-computability"><a class="header" href="#costs-and-computability">Costs and Computability</a></h3>
<h4 id="execution-costs"><a class="header" href="#execution-costs">Execution Costs</a></h4>
<p>Execution costs MAY be computed using a VM gas algebra similar to those used in L1 protocols. These costs are intrinsic to the L2 system and are naturally paid by clients.</p>
<p>For example, under NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards, the <a href="https://aptos.dev/en/network/blockchain/base-gas">Aptos Gas Algebra</a> should be used to compute execution costs.</p>
<p><strong>Proportionality of Execution Costs to DA Costs</strong>:
In the event that the gas algebra renders a cost proportional to the byte size of the transaction, this cost can be seen as accounting for some of the DA costs. For example, the “payload” summands in the Aptos Gas Algebra can be seen as accounting for some of the DA costs.</p>
<p>Since gas fees are then paid into the Governed Gas Pool which is eventually used to fund the FFS Rewards Pool, we identify that proper adjustment of the FFS rewards for operators can partially be accounting for by execution gas fees. However, we suggest this as a reliable means of ensuring the availability of proportional funds for the FFS rewards pool, not as a means of directly compensating operators.</p>
<p><strong>Proportionality of Execution Costs to Settlement Costs</strong>:
We do not expect the gas algebra to account for settlement costs. Under FFS, settlement costs proportional to the number of validators. The size of an individual attestation is fixed and rendered for a <strong>block range</strong>. Thus, larger transactions will not incur larger settlement costs than smaller transactions.</p>
<h4 id="da-costs"><a class="header" href="#da-costs">DA Costs</a></h4>
<p>Under NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards, DA fee computation MUST not actively use an oracle or other live pricing model to introduce DA fees directly as <strong>L2 client</strong> gas fees. The security concerns of using an oracle to compute DA are commented on below. Instead, NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards recommends regarding the DA fee passed to <strong>L2 clients</strong> as 0, and the DA fee passed to <strong>validators</strong> as whatever the extrinsic system charges.</p>
<p>As idenitfied in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pulls">MIP-19</a>, in general, DA costs will be proportional to the byte size of a transaction. However, many DAs implement a gas priority system that effectively introduces additional fees for network congestion. These fees are difficutl to anticiptate and are often unbounded.</p>
<p>For example, in Celestia, fees take the following <a href="https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/submit-data">form</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-math">\text{Total Fee} = \text{Gas Limit} * \text{Gas Price}
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Gas Limit</code> is the maximum amount of gas that can be used for the transaction and is proportional to the byte size of the transaction.</li>
<li><code>Gas Price</code> is a price set by the user to incentivize validators to include the transaction in the next block.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="settlement-costs"><a class="header" href="#settlement-costs">Settlement Costs</a></h4>
<p>Under NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards, settlement fee computation MUST not actively use an oracle or other live pricing model to introduce settlement fees directly as <strong>L2 client</strong> gas fees. The security concerns of using an oracle to compute settlement fees are commented on below. Instead, NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards recommends regarding the settlement fee passed to <strong>L2 clients</strong> as 0, and the settlement fee passed to <strong>validators</strong> as whatever the extrinsic system charges.</p>
<p>In general, settlement costs can be modeled in the following form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-math">\text{Settlement Cost} = \text{Number of Validators} * \text{L1 Gas Fee} 
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-math">+ \text{Postconfirmation L1 Gas fee}
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Number of Validators</code> is the number of validators participating in the settlement.</li>
<li><code>L1 Gas Fee</code> is the gas fee charged by the Settlement Layer for commitments of validators.</li>
<li><code>Postconfirmation L1 Gas fee</code> is the gas fee charged by the Settlement Layer for the Postconfirmation process and other functionality like rollover of epochs.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the size of an FFS attestion is constant for any transaction. <code>L1 Gas Fee</code> and <code>Postconfirmation L1 Gas fee</code> is not. Most L1s including, ETH, have implemented either gas priority systems or dynamic gas fees.</p>
<h3 id="comparisons-to-other-fee-models"><a class="header" href="#comparisons-to-other-fee-models">Comparisons to Other Fee Models</a></h3>
<h4 id="oracle-based-fee-models"><a class="header" href="#oracle-based-fee-models">Oracle-Based Fee Models</a></h4>
<p>In contrast to NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards, oracle-based fee models attempt to actively price <strong>L2 client</strong> gas fees according to the costs of operating the L2 system via both (1) the estimation or computation of DA and Settlement costs and (2) the computation of the value of the L2 gas token in terms of the DA and Settlement Layer gas tokens.</p>
<p>Above, we discussed why it is difficult to anticipate DA and Settlement costs. While the former can be forgone in the event that the DA is always finalized before execution, the latter cannot as execution must occur before settlement.</p>
<p>Additionally, however, using an oracle model introduces complexity and ultimately set of security risks.</p>
<p>If the oracle model is trusted to appropriately account for the conversion rate between the L2 gas token and the DA and Settlement Layer gas tokens, then the oracle model is a single point of failure. If the oracle model is trusted, then the system is vulnerable to manipulation by the oracle.</p>
<h4 id="wrapped-token-fee-models"><a class="header" href="#wrapped-token-fee-models">Wrapped Token Fee Models</a></h4>
<p>In contrast to NB-FFS Governed Fees and Rewards, wrapped token fee models attempt to wrap L2 transactions with corresponding DA and Settlement transactions, or else require native inclusion of requisite gas tokens in the L2 system.</p>
<p>However, while DA fees can be known at execution, Settlement fees cannot. Thus, the wrapped token model would only account for tight bound on DA costs and would need to adopt a pessimistic model for Settlement costs. This would result in overcharging for Settlement costs.</p>

<h3 id="pros"><a class="header" href="#pros">Pros</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delayed calculation of rewards to cover centralized expenses</strong>: because fees are held in the gas pool, the governing body need not calculate rewards which would be used to cover their own operating expenses until control of the governance is transferred to the community. The governing body can, for example, decide to use a percentage of captured gas to pay the centralized operators when a more stable token price is known some time after the L2 has been operational.</li>
<li><strong>On-chain safety of bridge</strong>: the insurance of the bridge makes on-chain guarantees that all losses from bridge failures can be covered. This is a significant improvement over the Bilbao Model which requires off-chain coordination to cover losses.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of migration</strong>: the model is designed to be easily migrated to a more decentralized model. The governing body can be replaced by a DAO or other decentralized governance model with minimal changes to the operational assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed migration of rewards</strong>: the model allows for the governing body to manually migrate rewards from the L2 to the L1. This allows for a more gradual transition to a decentralized model and can avoid attacks available in more tightly integrated models.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cons"><a class="header" href="#cons">Cons</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>High trust in governance</strong>: the model requires a high level of trust in the governing body. When the governing body is narrowly defined, this may not be significantly more open than the Bilbao Model.</li>
<li><strong>1:1 token correlation</strong>: the model asserts a 1:1 token correlation between the L1 staking and L2 gas tokens. This may not be desirable in all cases as exploits on the bridge may compromise the security of staking on the L1 or sybil resistance on the L2.</li>

<p>The <strong>Rate-Limiter</strong> for the HTLC-based Native Bridge (hereafter called Native Bridge) is introduced to de-escalate the risk of double-spends through the Native Bridge by limiting the number of tokens that can be transferred during a certain time frame. The rate limit is determined by the reaction time of the bridge operator, called the <strong>Risk Period</strong>, and the value locked in the <strong>Security Fund</strong>, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/50">MIP-50</a>.</p>
<p>The Native Bridge Rate Limiter is implemented through a contract on L1. This contract is governed by the Aptos governance framework, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/48/">MIP-48</a>, and can be updated through a governance process.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-22"><a class="header" href="#motivation-22">Motivation</a></h2>

If any of these would not hold, the Native Bridge could expose the network to double-spends.</p>

<em>Figure 1: Overview of the Rate-Limiter mechanism for the Native Bridge.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] In the following we note that when talk about the Rate-Limiter, we mean the Rate-Limiter contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The Rate-Limiter SHOULD be implemented as a contract on L1.</li>
<li>The Rate-Limiter MUST handle both the <strong>transfer directions</strong> L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1.</li>
<li>For either transfer direction the transfer value MUST be tracked, i.e. the transferred value for L1-&gt;L2 should be recored in <code>budget_L1L2</code> and for L2-&gt;L1 in <code>budget_L2L1</code>.</li>
<li>The Rate-Limiter SHOULD be governed by the Aptos governance framework, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/48/">MIP-48</a>, and can be updated through a governance process.</li>
<li>The security fund contract, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/50">MIP-50</a>, MUST update <code>security_fund</code> in the Rate-Limiter contract if the amount of funds changes in the security fund contract.</li>
<li>The <code>risk_period</code> value SHOULD be set by the governance process and updated through the governance process. It estimates the maximum reaction time to check whether transfers have been completed correctly.</li>
<li>For a given transfer direction, the Rate-Limiter should disable transfers across the bridge if the rate limit is exceeded for that transfer direction.</li>
<li>The rate limit MUST be set according to the equation <code>rate_limit = security_fund / risk_period * 0.5</code>. This is to ensure that each bridge transfer direction is ensured sufficiently.</li>
<li>The Rate-Limiter MUST reject a transfer request if the rate limit is exceeded for that transfer direction by that transaction. I.e. for L1-&gt;L2 the Rate-Limiter MUST reject any transfer that would violate <code>budget_L1L2 &lt; rate_limit</code> and for L2-&gt;L1 the Rate-Limiter MUST reject any transfer that would violate <code>budget_L2L1 &lt; rate_limit</code>.</li>
<li>The rate limitation should be applied at the earliest possible point on L1. For the L1-&gt;L2 transfer direction, according to <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/39">MIP-39</a> this is at the <code>init_bridge_transfer</code> function. While, for the L2-&gt;L1 transfer direction, it is the <code>lock_bridge_transfer</code> function.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="optimization"><a class="header" href="#optimization">Optimization</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The Rate-Limiter COULD be implemented as a contract on L2 to save on gas costs. However the security of this approach must be carefully evaluated, as the base truth for the protocol is the L1, which entertains ultimate settlement.</li>
<li>The rate limit COULD be unbalanced between the two transfer directions by a factor <code>weight</code>$\in [0,1]$. That is the equations would be <code>rate_limit_L1L2 = security_fund / risk_period * weight</code> and <code>rate_limit_L2L1 = security_fund / risk_period * (1-weight)</code>. This would allow for a more flexible rate limit, if the network experiences higher inflow into or outflow from L2.</li>
<li>The Rate-Limiter COULD consider the budget across both directions as a single budget. This would apply the above equation with a dynamic <code>weight</code>. However this raises the question of the asynchrony of events between the two directions, and such an approach should be analyzed carefully.</li>
<li>The <code>budget_L1L2</code> and <code>budget_L2L1</code> values COULD be reset, if the governance is convinced that all transfers have been processed correctly and are not revertible, however this is risky due to the introduction of human error. Alternatively, an automated approach could be considered that takes into account all completed transfers. However, this is out of scope for this MIP.</li>
<li>Alternatively to the security fund contract updating the <code>security_fund</code> value in the Rate-Limiter contract, the Rate-Limiter contract could read the <code>security_fund</code> value from the security fund contract. However, this raises the question of how regular the Rate-Limiter should update the value, and also it would imply that occasionally the Rate-Limiter could have an outdated value. It is more risky.</li>
<li>Rate limitation could be implemented on both sides of the bridge. This permits to inform the user at the earliest possible point that a transfer is rejected. However, naively, it would require two separate security fund pools (one on L1 and one on L2), and increase the amount of code, as contracts require implementation both on L1 and L2.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="limitations"><a class="header" href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<h4 id="security-considerations"><a class="header" href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a></h4>
<p>The Governance imposes a risk on the Rate-Limiter, as it could be manipulated by the governance which holds control over the <code>risk_period</code> value. However, the Governance is also responsible for the security fund and other components in the Network. Furthermore the Governance is designed with the intention of moving to a more decentralized design eventually.</p>
<h4 id="bad-user-experience-when-budget-is-nearly-exhausted"><a class="header" href="#bad-user-experience-when-budget-is-nearly-exhausted">Bad user experience when budget is nearly exhausted</a></h4>
<p>If the budget is nearly exhausted, the Rate-Limiter will reject transfers. This could lead to a bad user experience, as users would not be able to transfer tokens across the bridge. However, this is a necessary trade-off to ensure the security of the bridge.</p>
<p>User experience could be improved by having warnings issued by a client that reads the remaining budget from the Rate-Limiter contract. In particular the error <code>RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code> should be displayed to the user.</p>
<h2 id="reference-implementation-17"><a class="header" href="#reference-implementation-17">Reference Implementation</a></h2>
<h2 id="verification-21"><a class="header" href="#verification-21">Verification</a></h2>
<p>If the Rate-Limiter handles each transfer direction budget individually, requests for transfers are applied deterministically through the L1 ordering. Thus no asynchronous assumptions are introduced by the Rate-Limiter.</p>
<p>If the Security Fund contract updates the <code>security_fund</code> value in the Rate-Limiter contract, the Rate-Limiter can be sure to have the correct value for the rate limit.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-23"><a class="header" href="#abstract-23">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The Informer for the HTLC-based Native Bridge (in the following called simply the Native Bridge) is introduced to collect information about the state from L1 and L2 and provide this information to components of the Native Bridge. The provided information is critical to the safe operation of bridge components such as the Rate-Limiter, the Security Fund, and the Bridge Operator.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-23"><a class="header" href="#motivation-23">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Several components should react if the bridge is under attack. However these components require knowledge about the states of L1 and L2. In particular, the considered components are the insurance fund, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/50">MIP-50</a> and the Rate-Limiter, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/56">MIP-56</a>. In addition the operation of these components may be handled via a governance, which could also rely on state information.</p>
<p>The Informer is a trusted component that provides this information.</p>
<h2 id="specification-22"><a class="header" href="#specification-22">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<p><img src="Review/mip/informer/MIP/mip-57/overview.png" alt="Overview" />
<em>Figure 1: Dependencies of components on the Informer mechanism in the Native Bridge.</em></p>
<p>The informer collects information about the state of liquid $L1MOVE and $L2MOVE and provides this information to components of the Native Bridge. The Informer is a trusted component that is critical to the safe operation of the Native Bridge.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Informer is a component that MUST run a node or client on L1 and on L2.</li>
<li>On L1 the Informer SHOULD read the liquid supply <code>L1MOVE_circulating</code> of $L1MOVE token at the $k$-confirmed state. The definition of $k-confirmed$ is given in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/issues/838">Issue-838</a>.</li>
<li>On L2 the Informer SHOULD read the liquid supply <code>L2MOVE_circulating</code> of $L2MOVE token at the $m$-confirmed state.</li>
<li>The values for $k$ and $m$ MUST be the same as the value of $k$ and $m$ in the bridge parameters.</li>
<li>Since L1 blocks have timestamps we say the Informer reads <code>L1MOVE_circulating(t_L1)</code>.</li>
<li>We assume that L2 blocks acquire timestamps from the sequencing protocol, e.g. Celestia. Thus the Informer reads <code>L2MOVE_circulating(t_L2)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TLDR: Informer Information and Warnings</strong></p>
<p>The Informer SHOULD provide the information about the circulating $L1MOVE and $L2MOVE supply <code>MOVE_circulating(t)</code>, <a href="Review/mip/informer/MIP/mip-57/index.html#measuring-circulating-supply">see here</a>. The circulating supply is lowered from the desired maximum circulating supply <code>MOVE_Max</code> by the inflight tokens, <a href="Review/mip/informer/MIP/mip-57/index.html#inflight-tokens">see here</a>. The inflight-token can be over-approximated.</p>
<p>The Informer SHOULD provide a warning if the circulating supply exceeds the maximum circulating supply <code>MOVE_Max</code>. However, due difference in clocks between layers, <a href="Review/mip/informer/MIP/mip-57/index.html#difference-in-layer-timestamps">see here</a>, and the over-approximation of inflight-token, the measured circulating supply could be above <code>MOVE_Max</code>.</p>
<h4 id="measuring-circulating-supply"><a class="header" href="#measuring-circulating-supply">Measuring circulating supply</a></h4>
<p>The circulating supply of $MOVE token <code>MOVE_circulating(t) = L1MOVE_circulating(t) + L2MOVE_circulating(t)</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING] If we do not want to run into the risk that measured circulating supply may become invalidated through reorgs we COULD consider finalized states only, i.e. we would require <code>t_now - t &gt; max{t_L1finality,t_L2finality}</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="inflight-tokens"><a class="header" href="#inflight-tokens">Inflight tokens</a></h4>
<p>Inflight tokens are tokens that are locked (burned) on L1 (L2) but that are not yet minted (unlocked) on L2 (L1).</p>
<p>We refer to the following illustration for a bridge transfer from L1 to L2, which is taken from <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/39">MIP-39</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Review/mip/informer/MIP/mip-57/L1ToL2.png" alt="L1 to L2 Transfer" />
<em>Figure 2: Illustration of L1 to L2 token transfer process. Both the good path (transfer succeeds) and the bad path (transfer fails due to timeout) is shown.</em></p>
<p>Assume some $L1MOVE is locked (with finalization) at time $t_1$.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <strong>good path</strong> the equivalent $L2MOVE token is minted on L2 at time $t_2$, where $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 \in$<code>[2 * t_L2finality, t_L2finality + timelock2]</code>. In other words the total circulating supply of $MOVE is decreased by the amount of locked $L1MOVE tokens for $\Delta t$.</li>
<li>On the <strong>bad path</strong> there is no equivalent minted $L2MOVE token on L2 minted. Instead, after <code>timelock1</code> the locked $L1MOVE token is unlocked on L1. The total circulating supply of $MOVE is decreased by the amount of locked $L1MOVE tokens for <code>timelock1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the inverse transfer from L2 to L1 the same arguments hold.</p>
<p>The rate limit is determined by the reaction time of the bridge operator <code>risk_period</code>, and the value <code>security_fund</code> locked in the <strong>Security Fund</strong>, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/50">MIP-50</a>. We assume that L1-&gt;L2 is rate limited by <code>rate_limit_L1L2</code> and L2-&gt;L1 is rate limited by <code>rate_limit_L2L1</code>.</p>
<p>Then the maximum amount of tokens that can be inflight is determined by the bad path:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>inflight_L1L2 = ratelimit_L1L2 * risk_period * inflight_factor</code> for L1-&gt;L2, and</li>
<li><code>inflight_L2L1 = ratelimit_L2L1 * risk_period * inflight_factor</code> for L2-&gt;L1.</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code>inflight_factor = 1 + timelock / risk_period</code>. If we consider only the good path then the maximum amount of tokens that can be inflight is</p>
<ul>
<li><code>inflight_L1L2 = ratelimit_L1L2 * risk_period * 2</code> for L1-&gt;L2, and</li>
<li><code>inflight_L2L1 = ratelimit_L2L1 * risk_period * 2</code> for L2-&gt;L1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Measurement of inflight tokens</strong>
The Informer can provide an estimate on the inflight tokens. In particular it is aware how many tokens are inflight on L1 <code>token_inflight_L1</code> and also on L2 <code>token_inflight_L2</code>. The sum of which provides an upper, but much preciser bound on the inflight tokens. Note however that</p>
<p><code>MOVE_circulating(t) = L1MOVE_circulating(t) + L2MOVE_circulating(t) + token_inflight_L1 + token_inflight_L2 &gt;= MOVE_max</code>.</p>
<p>I.e. this measurement could overestimate the token supply.</p>
<h4 id="difference-in-layer-timestamps"><a class="header" href="#difference-in-layer-timestamps">Difference in Layer Timestamps</a></h4>
<p>The timestamps of the two layers are not synchronized. We assume that the difference is negligible, however, for correctness, the implications of a drift between the L1 and L2 clocks should be considered. Moreover, the clocks of the layers progress discretely. This means that the Informer has to read at slightly different times on L1 and L2.</p>
<p>This error in the calculation of circulating token <code>error_token_circulating</code> due to difference in timestamps between L1 and L2 can be net positive. Thus the measured circulating supply of $MOVE could be above <code>MOVE_max</code>.</p>
<p>Since the time difference should be small the error should be no more than the rate budget of two intervals, i.e. <code>error_token_circulating &lt;= (ratelimit_L1L2 + ratelimit_L2L1 ) * risk_period * 2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations"><a class="header" href="#recommendations">Recommendations</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>It is recommended that $k&gt;=32$, i.e. at least one epoch.</li>
<li>It is recommended that $m=3$.
On L2 we assume a pBFT-like algorithm for the consensus on transaction-blocks, If the protocol is pipelined, this would indicate that 3 blocks are required to finalize. If all phases of the BFT consensus algorithm are handled within one block, then $m=1$ is sufficient.
With Celestia this would be approximately after $36sec$. (The block time of $12sec$ is taken from the <a href="https://docs.celestia.org/tutorials/integrate-celestia">Celestia documentation</a> and the <a href="https://celestia.explorers.guru/">Celestia explorer</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="optimizations-1"><a class="header" href="#optimizations-1">Optimizations</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Instead of reading the $k$-confirmed state, the Informer COULD consider the finalized state. The finalized state is achieved approximately after two epochs (one epoch holds 32 blocks if no blocks are missed), see <a href="https://x.com/LogarithmicRex/status/1578540111930699778">this tweet</a> and <a href="https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain">this article</a>.</li>
<li>For security purposes the Informer COULD consider only the state produced by L2 blocks that have been <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/37">postconfirmed</a> on L1.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-24"><a class="header" href="#abstract-24">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This proposal advocates for replacing the current HTLC-based bridge design, which requires four transactions and introduces significant complexity, with a simpler and more efficient two-transaction mechanism. The proposed design reduces costs, enhances security, minimizes user friction, and avoids potential exploits caused by refund logic. It addresses long-standing issues such as reliance on sponsored transactions, outdated audits, and unimplemented fee mechanisms speeding the process to achieve a fully functional bridge that movement yet has been unable to complete, and lots of under issues raised and still pending.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-24"><a class="header" href="#motivation-24">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The current bridge design poses numerous challenges, including inefficiency, cost, and user frustration:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transaction Complexity</strong>: Requires four interactions:
<ul>
<li>Two by the user (initiation and finalization).</li>
<li>One by the relayer to complete the transaction.</li>
<li>One by a third party (tasked by the relayer) to finalize refunds in case of failure.</li>
<li>If any of these fails, users and the protocol face losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High Cost</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The multi-transaction setup is expensive for both users and the protocol.</li>
<li>Misestimations in fee calculations could result in significant losses.</li>
<li>Example: At 16 gwei, bridging costs $20 for 10k transactions. If fees are miscalculated by 25%, this leads to a $25k loss. At 100 gwei, the loss escalates dramatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unfriendly User Experience</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The current design requires users to have funds on the destination chain for finalization. This increases friction and discourages adoption.</li>
<li>Sponsored transactions are essential to the current implementation but remain unimplemented, leaving users stranded without funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Security Risks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Relayer keys are a critical point of failure. This assumption cannot be avoided.</li>
<li>Refund logic introduces vulnerabilities where attackers could exploit the rate limit and relayer downtime.</li>
<li>For instance, if the relayer fails to finalize on the initiator, a malicious actor could:
<ul>
<li>Take over the refund keys.</li>
<li>Exploit both directions of the bridge (e.g., ETH→MOVE and MOVE→ETH) repeatedly, draining funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Burden</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The current audit is outdated and does not reflect the significant changes made since.</li>
<li>The current design requires a complete UI/UX overhaul, adding complexity and delay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unnecessary Complexity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>HTLC-based bridges are largely abandoned in favor of simpler, more effective designs.</li>
<li>Examples like the <a href="https://github.com/Consensys/htlc-bridge">Consensys HTLC</a> bridge demonstrate the <a href="https://entethalliance.org/crosschain-bridges-overview-where-we-are-now/">pitfalls of such approaches</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Simplification</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure is still incomplete for the current HTLC bridge design and we are struggling to find sound solutions that balance UI/UX and security. For example, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/issues/838">this issue</a> regarding UX vs number of confirmations to require on the Ethereum side, is still under debate.</li>
<li>Because of the over-engineered design, infrastructure is prone to error and we might end up being damaged by the amount of infrastructure we have not built yet and has to be built for the relayer to fully function.</li>
<li>We could strip down the Relayer code and achieve a final design much more quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed lock/mint bridge design mitigates these issues, creating a safer, faster, and user-friendly bridge while maintaining operational reliability.</p>
<h2 id="specification-23"><a class="header" href="#specification-23">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The lock/mint bridge design focuses on minimizing complexity and maximizing security:</p>
<h3 id="protocol-description-1"><a class="header" href="#protocol-description-1">Protocol Description</a></h3>
<p>The bridge is a simpler version of the current implementation, which relies on the assumption that the Relayer Keys are not to be compromised.</p>
<p>L1 -&gt; L2</p>

<li>User initiates a bridge transfer on L1. Contract stores a mapping of the user bridgeTransferIds for easy access. It transfers from the user MOVE amount to the contract. Transaction emits originator, recipient, amount and nonce.</li>
<li>Relayer awaits for finalization of the transaction on L1.</li>

<li>Relayer completes the bridge on L1.</li>

<h3 id="key-features"><a class="header" href="#key-features">Key Features</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lock/Mint mechanism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initiation</strong>: User sends a transaction to initiate the bridge containing recipient and amount.</li>
<li><strong>Completion</strong>: A relayer or multi-signature group completes the transfer on the counterparty contract with the originator, recipient, amount and noce for hash verification.</li>
<li><strong>No Funds Requirement</strong>: User is not required to have funds on receiving chain and we do not have to build sponsored transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery by Relayer</strong>: Because the relayer delivers the funds, there is no requirement for the user to complete the transaction on receiving chain, therefore massively simplifying the user experience and allowing a smooth onboarding on the network for bridges from L1 to L2. User only has to await for the finalization on the source chain and for the relayer to perform the completion on receiving chain. This is standard practice for every major bridge in the ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Less parameters</strong>: Because there is no exchange of secrets between the user and relayer, we have a substantial reduction of logic.</li>
<li><strong>Only Completable</strong>: Currently we reserve a refunder role to revert transactions. This approach is different where we guarantee delivery of funds through the same party that would guarantee funds being refunded, because bridges can ONLY be completed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consolidation of Logic</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge lock and completion functionality on the counterparty contract. Once lock is called, funds are already in the control of the user. On the HTLC implementation, once the timelock is over and complete on initiator has not been called, both the initiator and counterparty funds are available to the user, opening up for an exploit.</li>
<li>Remove refund functionality entirely to eliminate associated exploits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parameter Validation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure parameter validation on the counterparty to prevent invalid transactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relayer Redundancy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use two types of relayers:
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated Relayer</strong>: Operated with minimal human involvement; its private key is highly secured.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Signature Relayer</strong>: Managed by the team to guarantee transaction completion in case of failures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize gas costs by reducing the number of interactions and simplifying fee calculations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid refund logic to close exploit windows.</li>
<li>Protect against key compromise through key isolation or known by no parties and multi-signature relayer setups.</li>
<li>There is no scenario where a bridge could lead to double-spending. It’s either completed by relayers or not.</li>
<li>User currently can loose its bridge <code>preImage</code> which could lead to them being unable to complete the bridge. By not relying on a <code>preImage</code> from the user, it minimizes issues. It is not a loss in security because the purpose of the <code>preImage</code> is solely for refunding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batch Processing for Downtime</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-signature relayers can process multiple pending transactions in a single batch during downtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BridgeTransferId</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue using unique identifier to prevent double-spending and track transactions securely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge Fee</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the L1 to L2 bridge, do not charge fees.</li>
<li>On the L2 to L1 bridge, charge a fee estimated by admin. It’s set to the gas spent in ethereum in move. This requires an oracle and can only be implemented after oracles are live and we are able to have a maintainer that is able to set the fees on L2.</li>
<li>Bridge fee should be a estimated by being a threshold between the current cost to perform the completeBridgeTransfer transaction on L1 (aka. <code>cost</code>) + 20%. Then, we set <code>cost</code> as the <code>upperbound</code>. The <code>lowerbound</code> is the <code>cost</code> - 10%. This prevents us from updating the fee too often and guaranteeing profit on bridges. We do have to consider gas spikes, but it should be a momentarily loss compensated by the extra charged and maintained by the <code>upperbound</code> and <code>lowerbound</code>.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>entry fun set_fee(caller: &amp;signer, fee: u64) {
   assert_is_maintainer(caller);
   borrow_global&lt;BridgeConfig&gt;(@aptos_framework).fee = fee;
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Adopt currently used bridge designs from established designs like Arbitrum, LayerZero and Blast bridges which use a relayer to finalize the bridge.</li>
<li>User is not required to have funds on counterparty contract to finalize the bridge.</li>

<li><strong>Key Compromise</strong>:

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Two-Transaction Flow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>User initiates the transfer.</li>
<li>Relayer or multisig completes the transfer with parameter validation.</li>
<li>Current HasuraDB built internally can provide enough infrastructure for users to know if their transaction has been completed. It does not differ from the current design in any way since user is not able to see if their transaction is in-flight. We could introduce this by notifying the user if the relayer has been ordered to complete the transaction.</li>
<li>There would be two states for user to reference, initiated or completed and those are the only two possible states. Funds can only be returned by bridging back.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Review/mip-58/MIP/mip-58/tx-history.png" alt="Transaction History" />
Here users would be able to see if the bridge has been completed. It’s either pending or completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batch Completion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multisig relayers process pending transactions in batches during downtime, ensuring timely resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contract Simplification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combine lock and completion functionality on the counterparty contract.</li>
<li>Remove refund logic to streamline operations and improve security.</li>
<li>Cheaper transactions because of reduction of logic.</li>
<li>Consolidate Initiator and Counterparty into a single contract (this might be the most dangerous thing proposed but it has already been proposed for current implementation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single-sided rate limiting
<ul>
<li>Rate limiting should be implemented on the L1 and maps each day to a budget, for each direction. Once the budget is reached on one of the directions, no more tokens can be transferred on that direction. The bridge is financially secured by an <code>insurance fund</code> maintained by Movement Labs and the maximum amount of tokens to be transferred per day, per direction is one quarter of the <code>insurance fund</code> balance. This is meant to account for the insurance fund to be able to insure all current funds already transferred and all tokens inflight, per direction.</li>
<li>The <code>insurance fund</code> maintains the rate limit budget by adjusting its own <code>$MOVE</code> balance. It should be either the Movement Labs multisig or a new multisig 1/3 if we choose to adopt an approach that requires more direct ability by the personnel.</li>
<li>Once the rate limit budget is reached, if no issues have been observed, operators should simply wait for the next day.</li>
<li>If an issue has been observed, an operator should simply transfer to the bridge contract the sum of the exploit size, being the result of additional supply on L1, outside of the bridge address, and the additional supply on L2. This action covers both cases where tokens were extracted from the bridge contract on L1 or over-minted on L2. Movement Foundation should evaluate the amount of tokens that should be held by the <code>insurance fund</code> after the incident and transfer to it the amount to reach that amount.</li>
<li>This approach is open to exploits where the relayer key is compromised. It would enable the exploiter to freely mint on L2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inbound rate limiting
<ul>
<li>Rate limiting should be implemented on both L1 and L2 for inbound transactions only. It maps a daily budget of inbound transactions and once it’s reached, the relayer cannot complete more transactions. The bridge is financially secured by two <code>insurance funds</code>, one on each side, maintained by Movement Labs, and the maximum amount of tokens to be transferred per day, per direction is half of each of its <code>insurance funds</code> balances. This is meant to account for all tokens already transferred and inflight, per direction.</li>
<li>The <code>insurance funds</code> maintain the rate limit budgets by adjusting its own <code>$MOVE</code> balance. They should be either Movement Labs multisigs or new multisigs 1/3 if we choose to adopt an approach that requires more direct ability by the personnel.</li>
<li>Once the rate limit budget is reached, if no issues have been observed, operators should simply wait for the next day.</li>
<li>If an issue has been observed, operators should transfer to the bridge address the exploit amount on the L1 and burn the exploit amount on the L2. Movement Foundation should evaluate the amount of tokens that should be held by the <code>insurance funds</code> and operators should receive those tokens and bridge tokens if an exploit occurred on L2.</li>
<li>This approach is more succetible to issues on the frontend because the frontend has to acknowledge rate limit budget and inflight tokens and inform users if the rate limit is about to be reached, not only if it has been reached.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge Fee</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When bridging from L1 to L2, the protocol, through the Relayer, sponsors the gas cost on Movement. We do not need to make any modification on contracts or Relayer to support it.</li>
<li>When bridging from L2 to L1, we have a few viable solutions but it’s preferrable to highlight two.
<ol>
<li>Relayer sets a fee on L2, a global variable that can be set at any given time. Considering that block validation time on L1 is bigger than on L2, it becomes a viable approach since L2 can rapidly adjust the fee according to the current block and always charge an above gas cost fee to assure that despite hiccups, the bridge is net positive. $MOVE is deducted from the amount of tokens that are currently being bridged and transferred to a funds manager. Input of the user is on the final value of tokens that it should receive on the L1. This gives the protocol a very reliable way to estimate how much MOVE will be charged and feed to the user a precise amount of tokens.</li>
<li>Enable the Relayer to specify on the L1 completeBridgeTransfer transaction, the bridge fee per transaction. The amount is deducted from the total amount of tokens that were bridged and transferred to a funds manager. The dangerous situation is that we expect to way for over 10 minutes before the transfer can occur, and this could lead to a big disparity between the expected amout of funds and the actual amount of tokens received.</li>

<p>Crosschain bridges allow assets to be transferred between different blockchains. This MIP provides some background on crosschain bridge designs and the trade-offs related to security, decentralization, and performance.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-25"><a class="header" href="#motivation-25">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>To transfer assets from Ethereum to the chain (and back), we have to employ a <em>bridge</em>. Ideally we would re-use an existing bridge, but there is no available bridge template from Ethereum to Move-based chains, so we have to design one.
Designing a bridge between two blockchains is a complex task. As pointed out in <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/bridges/#integrating-bridges">Bridges – Ethereum Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Building your own bridge</strong> – Building a secure and reliable bridge is not easy, especially if you take a more trust-minimized route. Moreover, it requires years of experience and technical expertise related to scalability and interoperability studies. Additionally, it would require a hands-on team to maintain a bridge and attract sufficient liquidity to make it feasible.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>To design our bridge, it may be useful to understand the main types of architectures, their strengths and weaknesses. It can also help us reflect on the different discussions and proposals (MIPs, MDs) and how they relate to the different architectures.</p>
<h2 id="definitions-and-bridge-introduction"><a class="header" href="#definitions-and-bridge-introduction">Definitions and Bridge introduction</a></h2>
<p>Bridge terminology is frequently ambiguous as the following shows but we attempt to clarify the terms used in this MIP.</p>
<p><strong>Base classes of bridges</strong> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634379">[5]</a></p>
<p>There are several base classes of bridges to apply to our setting. We select <strong>Native Bridge</strong> as the most appropriate for our use case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Bridges</strong> bootstrap liquidity from a base chain into a different chain, e.g. to onboard users and move value into a chain.</li>
<li><strong>Canonical Bridges</strong> is a term typically used to refer to L1 to L2 bridges, and have a similar meaning to Native Bridges. They typically take a longer period of time to bridge assets than liquidity networks as they require a time period for finality to be established, such as the challenge period for optimistic
rollups.</li>
<li><strong>Validating Bridges</strong> are bridges between Ethereum and another chain, where the bridge contract verifies the state updates proposed by the off-chain system.</li>
<li><strong>Validator or Oracle-based Bridges</strong> rely on a set of external validators or oracles to validate cross-chain transfers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
The term <strong>Native Bridge</strong> is used to refer to a bridge that transfers the native ERC-20 <code>$L1MOVE</code> token from a base chain (L1) to the <code>$L2MOVE</code> token on a different chain (L2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Liquidity Networks</strong> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634379">[5]</a></p>
<p>The term of Liquidity Networks is associated with</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous Liquidity Pools</strong> The majority of Liquidity Networks consist of two liquidity pools of assets - one on the source and the other on the destination chain. In this structure, an intermediary token can act as an exchange medium allowing accurate amounts of the final token to be transferred to the user and to rebalance the pools once a transaction has occurred, e.g. RUNE in Thorchain, or stablecoins such as USDC in Stargate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our setting the intermediary IS the final token, and this could be interpreted as a <strong>lock/unlock</strong> bridge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLP) with AMMs</strong> are a subset of Continuous Liquidity Pools that use Automated Market Makers (AMMs) in series. <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/40">MIP-40</a> has proposed such a design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of bridge mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of crosschain bridges. They differ in the way they handle the native assets (source chain) and the representation of the assets (wrapped asset) on the target chain.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>burn/mint</strong>: the asset is burned on the source chain and an asset is minted on the target chain.
<em>Supply: The bridge operator is in control of creating supply on both chains.</em></li>
<li><strong>lock/mint</strong>: the native asset (minted e.g. in an ERC20 contract) is locked on the source chain and a wrapped asset is minted on the target chain.
<em>Supply: The bridge operator is only in control of minting supply on the target chain (L2). On L1 the bridge operator holds a token pool into/from which tokens get locked/unlocked.</em></li>
<li><strong>lock/unlock</strong>: although difficult to classify in literature, this variant naturally completes the above two types. It may be classified as a subcategory of a swap, a <strong>liquidity network</strong> (see above), or it could be interpreted as a trusted <a href="https://medium.com/@0xmirai77/curve-v1-the-stableswap-invariant-f87ad7641aa0">Automated Market Maker (AMM) with a constant sum invariant</a>. The asset is locked on the source chain and unlocked on the target chain.
<em>Supply: The bridge operator is neither in control of creating new supply on the source chain nor on the target chain. The bridge operator only holds token pools into/from which tokens get locked/unlocked.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>To complete the lingo, we also mention the definition of swaps:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>swap (atomic)</strong>: A swap is a generic mechanism and allows to swap any asset for any other asset. As a result it can be used to implement a bridge. Assets are swapped from the source chain against, potentially non-equivalent tokens on the target chain. A swap involves two parties, Alice on chain A and Bob on chain B. Both Alice and Bob can withdraw from the swap deals at any time and have a time window to accept the swap deal <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3212734.3212736">[1]</a>,<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00778-021-00686-1">[2]</a>. A swap mechanism usually requires an <em>escrow</em> and a <em>time lock</em> mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
As both parties can decide to withdraw or accept the swap, a swap requires each party to independently issue a transaction on their chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Source and target imply direction: e.g. for a swap, burn/mint and lock/unlock between a user1 on chain A and a user2 on chain B, the source chain of user1 is chain A and the target chain is chain B. For these three bridge mechanisms the transfer in opposite direction would be called the same. In contrast, <strong>lock/mint</strong> implies that the source chain is the chain where the native asset lives. But the bridge also operates in the opposite direction - however a more correct term for the opposite directin would be a <strong>burn/unlock</strong> mechanism instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="specification-24"><a class="header" href="#specification-24">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<h3 id="crosschain-communication-and-the-relayer"><a class="header" href="#crosschain-communication-and-the-relayer">Crosschain communication and the Relayer</a></h3>
<p>The transfer of assets between two chains requires a mechanism to communicate between the two chains. This mechanism is necessarily off-chain: a chain can emit events/messages to a channel but cannot receive event from a channel (they need to be converted to transactions).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
Crosschain communications can be implemented using different strategies. For a bridge the most common is to use a <em>relayer</em> or <em>messenger</em> that listens to events on one chain and emits corresponding transactions on the other chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>relayer</em> can be <em>trusted</em> or <em>untrusted</em>. Trusted relayers are usually run by the bridge operator and users must trust the operator. Untrusted relayers (trustless bridges) rely on the trust assumptions on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum) and the target chain (e.g., Movement Network) and the bridge operator is not required to be trusted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
Trusted relayers are usually faster and more cost-effective, but not decentralized so not censorship resistant. Unstrusted relayers (trustless bridges) offer greater security and decentralization but are usually slower and more expensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several MIPs and MDs that discuss the relayer mechanism: <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/tree/primata/bridge-attestors/MD/md-21">MD-21</a>, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/46">MIP-46</a>, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/56">MIP-56</a>, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/57">MIP-57</a>, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/58">MIP-58</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-communicated"><a class="header" href="#what-is-communicated">What is communicated?</a></h3>
<p>The relayer mechanism is used to relay information about the <em>state</em> of one chain to the other chain. The relayer monitors the logs of a chain and relays event emitted to the logs. The logs are part of the <em>state</em> of the chain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
The information relayed by the relayer should be reliable and ideally immutable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the relayer relays incorrect information, the bridge can be <em>hacked</em> and assets <em>duplicated</em> or <em>stolen</em> (see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/blob/mip-move-bridge-architecture/MIP/mip-39/README.md">MIP-39</a>, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/tree/mip/security_falliblity/MIP/mip-46">MIP-46</a>) This problem is addressed in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/issues/838">issue-838</a>.</p>
<p>On Ethereum, a block is immutable when it is declared <em>final</em>. Until is is final, a block can be <em>reverted</em> (i.e., the transactions in the block are not executed).
Other criteria can be used to accept a block as <em>almost-final</em> with a risk that it is reverted, e.g. k-confirmations, where k is the number of blocks that have been added to the chain since the block was added, see also <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/issues/838">issue-838</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Since the introduction on blobs on Ethereum, the <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/big-blocks-blobs-and-reorgs/19674">probability of a 1-confirmed block being reverted is approximately 0.3%</a>, so 3 out of 1000, approximately once every hour. In contrast if a block is final, the probability of it being reverted is negligible as it is protected by the fully economic security of the Ethereum finality mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="trusted-relayer"><a class="header" href="#trusted-relayer">Trusted Relayer</a></h3>
<p>Using a trusted relayer is a popular choice. The trust assumption on the relayer are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[safety]</strong> it relays  only final states of the chain (source or target).</li>
<li><strong>[liveness]</strong> it relays the states in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[safety]</strong>
In the lock/mint design with a trusted relayer, the relayer can mint assets on the target chain. If the relayer is compromised, the assets can be duplicated or stolen. Special care should be taken to ensure that the relayer is not compromised (multisig?).</p>
<p><strong>[liveness]</strong>
Even if the relayer is not compromised, it is hard to guarantee that the relayer will relay each event within a fixed time bound.</p>
<ol>
<li>The message delivery network can be slow or congested.</li>
<li>The relayer submits a transaction (to mint the assets on the target chain) to the mempool of the target chain. But the target chain may be down, congested or slow, or the relayer’s transaction may be low priority.</li>
<li>The relayer must cover the cost of submitting transactions on the target chain. If the relayer’s funds are low (or gas price is high), the relayer may not be able to submit the transaction.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="designs"><a class="header" href="#designs">Designs</a></h3>
<p><strong>HTLC-based design</strong></p>
<p>Our initial bridge design, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/rfcs/blob/main/0040-atomic-bridge/rfc-0040-atomic-bridge.md">RFC-40</a>, is based on an <em>atomic swap</em> (4. above).  The current architecture of our bridge, <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/blob/mip-move-bridge-architecture/MIP/mip-39/README.md">MIP-39</a>, borrows ideas from <em>lock/mint</em> and <em>swap</em> (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts">HTLC</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>if a user wants to bridge from Ethereum to Movement Network, they have to submit two independent transactions: one on Ethereum (lock) and one on Movement Network (mint). This is not user friendly and may be a barrier to adoption.</li>
</ul>
<!-- A bridge is slightly different to a swap in the sense that the two transactions (lock and mint) are not meant to be decoupled.-->
<ul>
<li>another issue is that the first transfer of MOVE tokens requires a user to have some <em>gas tokens</em> (the token used to pay execution fees on the Movement Network). If the gas token is the <code>$L2MOVE</code> token, we have to implement a mechanism to sponsor the first transfer of MOVE tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lock/Mint design</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
A simple <em>lock/mint</em>, <em>burn/mint</em> or <em>lock/unlock</em> mechanism requires only one transaction from the user and is probably more user friendly than the HTLC-based design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple design that is adopted by many L2 chains is the <em>lock/mint</em> design. A user initiates a transfer on the source chain and the bridge operator is responsible for completing the transfer on the target chain. In this design, the trust assumptions are that the contracts on the source chain and the target chain are <em>correct</em> and implement the lock and mint operations correctly (respectively burn and unlock for the opposite direction).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/58/files">MIP-58</a> is an instance of a <em>lock/mint</em> bridge. Once initiated on the source chain, the user does not need to interact with the target chain to complete the transfer. The bridge operator is responsible for coupling the lock/mint transactions for L1-&gt;L2 transfers. Similarly for L2-&gt;L1 transfers, the bridge operator is responsible for the coupling of the burn/unlock transactions.</p>

<p>See <a href="Review/mip-crosschain-bridges-background/MIP/mip-60/index.html#58">Trusted Relayer design</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming we have a <em>correct</em> implementation of the lock/mint contracts on the source and target chains, and a trusted relayer, we may still have to deal with the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relayer is down (or network is slow): how do we detect that the relayer is down? And what measurements are taken.</li>
<li>How long does it take to complete a transfer? After what time can we consider the transfer as unsuccessful?</li>
<li>How do we cancel transfers? Is it a manual process or do we have a mechanism to automatically cancel transfers and refund users?</li>
<li>We have to accurately estimate the cost of the transfer to charge the user for the relayer transaction on the target chain.</li>
<li>How do we mitigate the risk of gas fees manipulation? For example, if gas fees are low on the L2 chain (which is the expectation), users can submit thousands of transfer transactions. If at the same time, the gas fees are high on the L1, the relayer will incur some large costs to unlock the locked assets.</li>
<li>How do we ensure that for a given (successful) transfer initiation on the source chain, the relayer does not accidentally mint (or unlock) tokens twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bridging mechanisms on Arbitrum and Optimism use a <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/cross-chain-messaging">generic message passing framework</a> to communicate between chains. This relies on <em>retryable transactions</em> up to a certain number of retries or deadline.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This MIP describes the process for continuous operation as well as the bootstrapping of the relayer in the lock/mint bridge.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:andreas.penzkofer@movementlabs.xyz">Andreas Penzkofer</a>, <a href="Review/mip/relayer-bootstrap-and-reboot/MIP/mip-61/">Phillipe</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-26"><a class="header" href="#abstract-26">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>We describe an algorithm that</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuously checks for <code>initiate_transfer</code> events on the source chain.</li>
<li>Issues a <code>complete_transfer</code> transaction on the target chain if not done so far.</li>
<li>Checks the completion of transfers on the target chain.</li>
<li>Records the source chain block height, below which all transfers are completed on the target chain.</li>
<li>Provides a bootstrap algorithm for the relayer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this algorithm the target chain contract offers a <code>complete_transfer</code> function that records transfer by <code>nonce</code> and protects against re-issuance as any nonce can be only mapped to one transfer.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-26"><a class="header" href="#motivation-26">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>We would like to minimize the number of trusted components. In a minimal solution the relayer should only trust the source chain, the target chain and itself. Other trusted sources can be proposed optionally, but ideally no other trust assumptions should be utilized.</p>
<p>Several complications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>complete_transfer</code> message to the target chain for bridge transfers may fail, get lost, or other. Hence we cannot rely on delivery.</li>
<li>The relayer may loose local memory.</li>
<li>The relayer may have to be replaced.</li>
<li>The relayer (or its replacement) MUST not ignore a single transfer.</li>
<li>The relayer (or its replacement) MUST deliver eventually all transfers.</li>
<li>The finality criteria on the source chain and target chain MUST be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping</strong>
Currently, when the relayer starts, it doesn’t reload the state that it has when it shuts down. If transfers are processed when the relayer stops, the transfers are lost and the relayer is not able to continue the transfer.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the data would be stored on where to continue, the relayer may crash for a variety of reasons. The relayer can go offline or crash. It needs to automatically understand which <code>complete_transfer</code> messages it still needs to send to the target chain.</p>
<h2 id="context"><a class="header" href="#context">Context</a></h2>
<p>This algo is defined using the lock/mint-type Native Bridge protocol, described in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/58">MIP-58</a>.This bridge protocol has two function calls :</p>
<ul>
<li><code>initiate_transfer</code> on the source chain (called by user)</li>
<li><code>complete_transfer</code> on the target chain (called by relayer)</li>
</ul>
<p>This algorithm is compatible with using finalized blocks (see the remark on L2 complete verification). By pulling only finalized source blocks, the nonce are always updated on finalization.</p>
<p>In this MIP we consider the lock/mint Native Bridge, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/60">MIP-60</a>. We will discuss a single direction of transfer - from <strong>source chain</strong> to <strong>target chain</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="specification-25"><a class="header" href="#specification-25">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.</p>
<p>!!! . The algorithm is the same in both directions. Hence each algorithm has to be implemented twice. Once for the transfer direction L1 –&gt; L2, and once for the L2 –&gt; L1 direction.</p>
<p>The relayer can get its state from the source chain and target chain. The relayer operates two processes - potentially in parallel:</p>
<p><strong>1. CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING</strong>: The relayer pulls transfer events from new finalized blocks from the source chain and processes them. Since we consider finalized blocks and this is a blockchain, new blocks are processed in order. For each transfer the relayer has to check if the transfer is completed on the target chain, and if not it has to complete the transfer.</p>
<p><strong>2. BOOTSTRAPPING:</strong> The relayer initiate the event polling at some point in the past. This point is either the genesis, some configurable source block height, or some checkpoint (possibly set on-chain)</p>
<h3 id="structures"><a class="header" href="#structures">Structures</a></h3>
<p>On the source chain the following structure is used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Source Chain Structure
{
    nonce: Number,          // Unique incrementing value for ordering transfers
    recipient: String,  // Address of the recipient on the target chain
    initiator: String,   // Address of the initiator on the source chain
    amount: Number          // Amount being transferred
}
</code></pre>
<p>On the target chain the following structure is used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Target Chain Structure
{
    nonce: Number,         // Matching nonce from the source chain
    transferUID: String,   // Unique identifier for the transfer
    recipient: String,     // Address of the recipient
    initiator: String,      // Address of the initiator
    amount: Number         // Amount that was transferred
}
</code></pre>
<p>Locally the relayer stores the following structure:</p>
<p>!!! . TODO should be replaced by ordered list of transferIDs and a nonce list (ordered) and a block height</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Relayer Local Structure
{
    blocks: [                          // Array of blocks being tracked
        {
            blockHeight: Number,       // Height of the block
            status: String,            // Status of the block (e.g., "processed", "completed")
            events: [                  // Array of events in the block
                {
                    eventUID: String,  // Unique identifier for the event
                    nonce: Number,     // Matching nonce from the source chain
                    status: String     // Status of the event (e.g., "pending", "completed")
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="event_processing"><a class="header" href="#event_processing">EVENT_PROCESSING</a></h3>
<p>The relayer may send a message <code>complete_transfer</code> to the target chain for an event that has the status <code>transfer_pending</code>. This status exists during the time between the reception of the <code>initiate_transfer</code> event from the source chain and the success of the <code>complete_transfer</code> transaction on the target chain. (However, it is possible that a <code>complete_transfer</code> messages is not yet finalized on the target chain, in which case the relayer DOES NOT send a new <code>complete_transfer</code> message, but waits instead.)</p>
<p>The Native Bridge protocol MUST implement the assignment of an incrementing <code>nonce</code> on the source chain. Since there are two directions there MUST be two types of counters (<code>nonces</code>) - one for each transfer direction. The <code>nonce</code> is used to order the transfers.</p>
<p>For each <code>initiate_transfer</code> event do the following:</p>
<p><img src="Review/mip/relayer-bootstrap-and-reboot/MIP/mip-61/event_processing.png" alt="event_processing" /></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">EVENT_PROCESSING:
// Input: initiate_transfer_event from source chain

// Check if the `nonce` is already recorded
IF `nonce` is recorded THEN:
    IF `nonce.status_transfer` is `transfer_completed` THEN:
        RETURN.

    ELSE:
        // the status should be `transfer_pending`
        IF `nonce.status_transfer` is NOT `transfer_pending` THEN:
            LOG "error: nonce.status_transfer is not transfer_pending"
        SET `nonce.status_transfer` to `transfer_pending`
        SET timeout for relayer to re-check later

<p>Next we describe the processing of source blocks and the completion of a transfer on the target chain, assuming the relayer is always online. Since this is a strong assumption, we reduce this requirement in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="bootstrapping"><a class="header" href="#bootstrapping">BOOTSTRAPPING</a></h3>
<p>Next we describe how the bootstrap algorithm works and differs from the above.</p>
<p>!!! . A node that is bootstrapping SHOULD start the <a href="Review/mip/relayer-bootstrap-and-reboot/MIP/mip-61/index.html#continuous-block-processing">CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING</a> algorithm in parallel. This allows to immediately assume normal operation while attempting to catch up with what has been missed.</p>
<p><img src="Review/mip/relayer-bootstrap-and-reboot/MIP/mip-61/bootstrap.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>The Algorithm differs from the CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING in that it runs in parallel and will catch up with missing transfers eventually. While not hindering the continuous operation of the Relayer. It implements a delay to start at the beginning, which conveniently prevents that <code>complete_transfer</code> transactions would be sent accidentally twice to the target chain (and which if it would happen frequent could turn out to be expensive).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">BOOTSTRAPPING
// Start the continuous block pocessing protocol in parrallel to this algorithm
START CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING protocol 
SET `first_CP_block` = first processed block by CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING

// Set initial processed block parameters
SET `end_source_block` = `first_CP_block` - 1
SET `start_source_block` = some INPUT value

// Wait for a predefined time (e.g. 10 minutes) 
// to ensure all relevant blocks have arrived
WAIT for `wait_time` 

// Process source blocks in the specified range
FOR `current_block` = `start_source_block` TO `end_source_block` DO:
    RUN CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING using `current_block` as the source block.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bootstrap-input-types"><a class="header" href="#bootstrap-input-types">Bootstrap input types</a></h4>
<p><strong>Manual input</strong>
Based on knowledge of when the relayer stopped, we can inject a parameter about the source block height from which the relayer should start to bootstrap. Default is the genesis or some arbitrary long interval in the past, e.g. 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Reading from local memory</strong>
In the CONTINUOUS_BLOCK_PROCESSING Algorithm the Relayer can record the height of the source block <code>completed_block_height</code> as described in the Calculation-Completed-Block-Height algorithm. When rebooting or bootstrapping the node, the relayer can start from the last point it left.</p>
<p><strong>Reading from chain</strong>
The relayer records on the source or target chain (whichever is cheaper) the <code>completed_block_height</code> (see <a href="Review/mip/relayer-bootstrap-and-reboot/MIP/mip-61/index.html#calculation-of-completed-source-block-height">PROCESS_COMPLETED_NONCE_HEIGHT</a>. This can happen infrequent. A separate algorithm needs to be spelled out which records the highest source block, below which all source blocks with transfers are completed.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-27"><a class="header" href="#abstract-27">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This MIP introduces fastConfirmations on L2 as confirmations in addition to L2-level confirmations. fastCconfirmations are a way to settle transactions on the L2 with fast confirmation times. This is achieved by using the L2 as a settlement layer for the <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/34">Fast Finality Settlement mechanism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-27"><a class="header" href="#motivation-27">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>We introduce postConfirmations on L1 in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/37">MIP-37</a>. While postConfirmations partially draw from Ethereum security, they are  slow due to the finality time on Ethereum, and also expensive due to high L1 (Ethereum) fees.</p>
<p>In contrast finality times on the L2 are much faster and fees are much lower. This justifies the introduction of fastConfirmations on the L2 as a way to settle transactions on the L2 with fast confirmation times, but without any additional security guarantees from the L1.</p>
<p>However, postConfirmations are a simple yet elegant design which permits implementation with</p>
<ul>
<li>high decentralization capability</li>
<li>no requirements on p2p networking between validators</li>
<li>no consensus required.</li>
</ul>
<p>PostConfirmations can draw from the consensus progress on L1. Similarly, fastConfirmations can draw from the consensus progress on block-content on L2, which is independent of the confirmation of states.</p>

<p>The sequencer outputs protoBlocks, which are ingested by validators. From these protoBlocks, the validators calculate the state of the ledger and calculates the next L2block.</p>
<p>The shared sequencer can serve multiple ledgers (also called <em>chains</em>). Validators can query for new protoBlocks and separate their transactions out by namespace. Alternatively validators could request based on namespace and receive a transaction stream specific to the chain. For simplicity we continue to refer to a protoBlock when discussing the pre-stage of the next L2block but in a shared setting protoBlock(namespace) would be more accurate.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The Informer collects data from L1 and L2 about the supply of $MOVE tokens and forwards the information to relevant parties, which is critical for the safe operation of the Native Bridge.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="abstract-28"><a class="header" href="#abstract-28">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>The Informer V1 (hereafter simply called Informer) for the Lock/Mint-Native Bridge (in the following simply referred to as Native Bridge) is introduced to collect information about the state from L1 and L2 and provide this information to components of the <strong>Governance</strong> or the <strong>Governance Operator</strong>. The information is not based on the total supply but rather circulating supply on L2 and locked supply on L1. The provided information is critical for the safe operation of bridge components such as the Rate Limiter, the Security Fund, and the Bridge Operator.</p>
<p>The Informer V1 is limited in scope and capabilities with the intention that future releases will expand its monitoring capabilities. For example the calculation of inflight tokens is optional in this version, and is listed for future versions.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-28"><a class="header" href="#motivation-28">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Several components should react if the bridge is under attack or faulty. In particular, the considered components are the Insurance Fund, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/50">MIP-50</a> and the Rate Limiter, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/56">MIP-56</a>.</p>
<p>The Operator that controls these components requires knowledge about the states of minted or locked tokens on L1 and L2. The Operator is an entity (e.g. multisig human) that has the ability to sign transactions and send funds from the Security Fund. Moreover, the operation of the components may also be handled via a governance, which could also rely on state information.</p>

<em>Figure 1: Dependencies of components on the Informer mechanism in the Native Bridge.</em></p>
<p>The Informer collects information about the state of $L1MOVE and $L2MOVE and provides this information to the Governance Operator who controls relevant components of the Native Bridge. The Informer is a trusted component that is critical to the safe operation of the Native Bridge.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Informer is a component that MUST run a node or client on L1 and on L2 to be able to extract information about the states of the chains.</li>
<li>On L1 the Informer SHOULD read the supply <code>L1MOVE_locked</code> of $L1MOVE token at the finalized state.</li>
<li>On L2 the Informer SHOULD read the circulating supply <code>L2MOVE_minted</code> of $L2MOVE token at the finalized state. The <code>L2MOVE_minted</code> value MUST consider the amount of burned tokens through transfers from L2 to L1 (<code>initiate_transfer</code> calls on L2), such that the <code>L2MOVE_minted</code> represents the circulating supply of $L2MOVE on L2.</li>
<li>Since L1 blocks have timestamps we say the Informer reads <code>L1MOVE_locked</code> at time <code>t_L1</code>.</li>
<li>We assume that L2 blocks acquire timestamps from the sequencing protocol, e.g. Celestia. Thus the Informer reads <code>L2MOVE_minted</code> at time <code>t_L2</code>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Instead of the finalized state we could also consider the $k$-confirmed state for the L1. The definition of $k$-confirmed is given in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/issues/838">Issue-838</a>. Similarly, for the L2, we could assume some different confirmation level like the fast-confirmation, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/65">MIP-65</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the Relayer may use a confirmation level that is not the finalization, we add the following requirement:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The confirmation levels for the Informer MUST be the same as for the Relayer.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="dissemination-of-information"><a class="header" href="#dissemination-of-information">Dissemination of information</a></h4>
<p>We do not prescribe a particular dissemination method.  In case the Informer detects possible threat, the Informer MAY provide the information to the Governance Operator via publishing a notification and which then alerts the Operator via a PagerDuty service to relevant personal.</p>
<h4 id="locked-and-minted-supply-difference"><a class="header" href="#locked-and-minted-supply-difference">Locked and minted supply difference</a></h4>
<p>The Informer MUST provide the information about the difference of locked $L1MOVE and minted $L2MOVE supply <code>MOVE_diff</code>. This indirectly informs, whether there is an issue with the total circulating supply of $MOVE across the L1 and L2. The Informer provides this information at time <code>t'</code>, where <code>t' ~ max{t_L1,t_L2}</code>). It is approximate, since the local time of the informer may differ from the chain clocks. However, it can only provide guarantees for <code>t = min {t_L1,t_L2}</code>, which is discrete block time.</p>
<p>The Informer MUST measure <code>MOVE_diff(t) = L1MOVE_locked(t_L1) - L2MOVE_mint(t_L2)</code> and the condition <code>is_MOVE_diff_safe = (MOVE_diff &lt; 0)</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
<code>CONDITION_1</code> :  The Informer warns if <code>is_MOVE_DIFF</code> is false. This is because in this scenario the circulating supply exceeds the maximum circulating supply <code>MOVE_Max</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="optional-inflight-tokens"><a class="header" href="#optional-inflight-tokens">(Optional:) Inflight tokens</a></h4>
<p>The Informer MAY calculate the in-flight tokens. Inflight tokens are tokens that are locked (burned) on L1 (L2) but that are not yet minted (unlocked) on L2 (L1) with a <strong>finalized state</strong>. With respect to finalized states it should be <code>MOVE_inflight = MOVE_diff</code>.</p>
<p>We can further differentiate the inflight tokens, however this considers non-finalized events and thus results may not be precise or may even revert.</p>
<p>We can differentiate the following types of inflight tokens:</p>
<ol>
<li>transfer is processed by the Relayer and the <code>complete_transfer</code> transaction is recorded on the target chain but not finalized. This includes the sets <code>L1MOVE_inflight_processing</code> and <code>L2MOVE_inflight_processing</code>.</li>
<li>transfer is initiated on source chain but the Relayer has not yet processed the transfer. This includes the sets <code>L1MOVE_inflight_init</code> and <code>L2MOVE_inflight_init</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Informer can measure <code>L1MOVE_inflight_processing</code> and <code>L2MOVE_inflight_processing</code> by reading the non-finalized state of the respective chain.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations-1"><a class="header" href="#recommendations-1">Recommendations</a></h2>
<h4 id="possible-measurement-errors"><a class="header" href="#possible-measurement-errors">Possible measurement errors</a></h4>
<p>The timestamps of the two layers are not synchronized. We assume that the difference is negligible, however, for correctness, the implications of a drift between the L1 and L2 clocks should be considered. Moreover, the clocks of the layers progress discretely. This means that the Informer reads events from L1 and L2 with slightly different time stamps. This timestamp difference can introduce errors in the calculation of circulating token.</p>
<h4 id="slow-chain"><a class="header" href="#slow-chain">Slow chain</a></h4>
<p>The Informer may receive block events delayed from one of the chains. Consequently, finalized <code>complete_transfer</code> transactions on the target chain could be read before their respective <code>initiate_transfer</code> counterpart from the source chain. In this case the <code>MOVE_diff</code> could trigger <code>CONDITION_1</code> albeit the chains are safe. To improve on this, the Informer SHOULD only consider transfers for which the <code>initiate_transfer</code> is on the target chain.</p>
<p>We currently have a counter called <code>nonce</code> implemented. Since this counter strictly increases on the source chain, we could improve the Informer by keeping two types of lists locally off-chain: <code>LtargetMOVE_completed_but_init_missing</code> and <code>LtargetMOVE_completed_with_init</code>. The Informer SHOULD only consider <code>LtargetMOVE_completed_with_init</code> and updates the list when the corresponding <code>initiate_transfer</code> becomes available.</p>
<h4 id="unsafe-relayer-operation-and-reorg-protection"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-relayer-operation-and-reorg-protection">UNSAFE Relayer operation and reorg protection</a></h4>
<p>The postconfirmation process is a synchronization mechanism for L2 to L1, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/37">MIP-37</a>. It is also an anchoring mechanism that protects against reorgs. If the Relayer only processes postconfirmed states, this forces synchronization between L2 to L1.</p>
<p>If the Relayer is set up to operate in an UNSAFE mode and completes transfers based on only fast-confirmations, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/65">MIP-65</a>, or even simply based on states computed from protoBlocks that are issued by the sequencer, the Relayer SHOULD warn about this or the operator MUST at least be aware of this.</p>

<h3 id="lockmint-native-bridge"><a class="header" href="#lockmint-native-bridge">Lock/Mint-Native Bridge</a></h3>
<p>Factually the Lock/Mint-Native Bridge has been introduced prior to the co-location. However, to categorize it within a model, the SanFran Model seems suitable.</p>
<p>We are moving away from the HTLC Native Bridge, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/tree/main/MIP/mip-39">MIP-39</a> to the subjectively simpler design of a Lock/Mint Native Bridge, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/58">MIP-58</a>. For a general overview of bridge designs, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/60">MIP-60</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bridge-fees"><a class="header" href="#bridge-fees">Bridge fees</a></h3>
<p>In order to operate sustainably we require that the bridge fees cover expenditures of the operator sufficiently. We propose an approach for appropriate fee calculation in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/58">MIP-58</a>.</p>
<h3 id="relayer---continuous-operation-and-bootstrapping"><a class="header" href="#relayer---continuous-operation-and-bootstrapping">Relayer - Continuous Operation and Bootstrapping</a></h3>
<p>Introduce an algorithm for continuous operation and bootstrapping for the Relayer, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/61">MIP-61</a>.</p>

<p>With the change of the Native Bridge design the requirements, conditions and parameters have changed. <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/74">MIP-74</a> updates the Rate Limiter to the new setting.</p>
<h3 id="add-fastconfirmations"><a class="header" href="#add-fastconfirmations">Add fastconfirmations</a></h3>
<p>In order to facility fast confirmations as requested by the Fast-Finality Settlement mechanism, we require confirmations on the L2 in addition to the confirmations on the L1 (postconfirmations, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/37">MIP-37</a>).</p>
<p>We propose such a mechanism called fastconfirmation in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/65">MIP-65</a>.</p>

<p>In the current MCR implementation, the last attester which trips the <code>rollOverEpoch</code> function may pay large gas fees, as they perform roll-over work for previous participants. This would create a disincentive for the last attester to participate in the game, potentially not doing so at all. It has been presumed that the implementation would be updated s.t. the last attester would be specially rewarded for their work. This also creates a game-theoretic problem, as the last attester could be incentivized to wait until the last moment to participate.</p>
<p>To combat this, round-robin rewarding and commitment schemes such as Pedersen Commitments have been suggested. However, these have not been formalized.</p>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: A researcher or protocol implementer can understand what transaction fairness means in the Suzuka Network.</p>

<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This will prevent DOS attacks on the network by requiring a stake to submit blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to consider what is lost in this approach. For example, currently, a developer could bypass a Suzuka Full Node an submit directly to the DA–allowing them to avoid any potential censorship. This would be lost in a naive implementation of this approach, as they would be required to either (a) submit via a full-node or (b) stake themselves.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="overview-8"><a class="header" href="#overview-8">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Suzuka Network is known to be subject to MEV exploits in the form of manipulating block size and order. That is, while transactions within a block are ordered deterministically, full nodes are currently given freedom to chose which transactions to include in a block and when to send those blocks to the network. Execution-level validation will only assert that the sequence numbers are appropriate and other dApp-specific logic. There are no penalties for being to have withheld a transaction.</p>
<p>The desiderata presented herein request a complete model of MEV in the Suzuka Network. They also make some provisional requests based on surmised ways to prevent certain MEV attacks.</p>
<p>Most of the account of MEV attacks should be based on the model of transaction fairness given in <a href="Review/l-monninger/block-validation/MD/md-7/../md-6/README.html">MD-6</a>.</p>
<p>Many of MEV attacks addressed can also be classed as censorship attacks. That is, a miner can choose to not include a transaction in a block. This is a form of censorship. As such, the desiderata herein also address censorship attacks.</p>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Whenever Timelock is consumed, it is consumed as <code>timelock * 2</code>. If a modifiable state, it should be at least 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Because it has to be higher than the Counterparty Contract Timelock, <code>timelock * 2</code> is reasonable. A modifiable state should have some form to prevent malicious attacks. If lowering becomes a necessity, an upgrade to the contract will solve the issue. <code>timelock * 2</code> consumption also introduces a requirement from the design which stipulates that the initiator timelock has to be significantly higher than the counterparty to assure that a bridge transfer cannot be completed on the target chain and cancelled on the origin chain.</p>

Runes is the best solution.</a></h3>
<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Users can use MOVE on Bitcoin in a manner similar to how users use ERC-20 tokens to interact with Ethereum dApps.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Since mid-2023, NFT trading volume on Bitcoin has rivaled and, many weeks, been greater than Ethereum NFT volume. <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/nft-overview/nft-trade-volume-by-chain">Source: The Block</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin’s market cap is over 1 trillion USD while Ethereum’s is under 300 billion USD. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Source: CoinMarketCap</a></p>
<p>This signifies tremendous growth potential for commercial activity on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin fungible asset protocol BRC-20 has been overshadowed in popularity by <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/runes.html">runes</a>, a protocol that uses Bitcoin transaction outputs to create fungible assets on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin community has embraced runes. The runestone NFT was airdropped to ordinals holders by community figure Leonidas, who then airdropped multiple runes to runestone holders. Many communities in Bitcoin have launched runes for their brand. No other fungible asset protocol on Bitcoin has a comparable way of storing protocol messages in Bitcoin transaction outputs. Both technically and community-wise, runes are the most native fungible asset protocol on Bitcoin (as contrasted with inefficient protocols like BRC-20 that rely on ordinal inscriptions, which are NFTs clevery disguised as fungible assets).</p>
<p>Runes was developed by Casey Rodarmor, author of the command runner <code>just</code> which we use in Suzuka. Rodarmor invented ordinals, which are fairly certainly here to stay.</p>
<p>There will be FUD always, and new protocols continually developed. For example, <a href="https://x.com/udiWertheimer/status/1833667484915737034">Udi Wertheimer’s CATNIP protocol</a> appears to have recent support. However, CATNIP relies on <a href="https://github.com/bip420/bip420">OP_CAT</a> being restored as a Bitcoin opcode. So it’s not even part of Bitcoin yet. And Udi claims <a href="https://x.com/udiWertheimer/status/1833685416362336476">CatVM will support runes</a>, so even if CATNIP becomes the dominant protocol, runes will still be supported.</p>
<p>People claiming that runes are dead ought to understand that in general, on-chain activity it at a low point and so NFTs and fungible assets are all performing underwhelmingly. (See the NFT volume comparison from The Block in the first paragraph of this Justification section. Markets are just low-volume right now.) The reality is that runes will be supported in the future. Movement could potentially migrate Bitcoin fungible assets to another protocol should it seem reasonable to do so. For now and the foreseeable future, runes are the best bet for MOVE on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>As an example of runes being very much well and alive, <a href="https://x.com/PupsToken/status/1832831489840443579">Pups token recently announced</a> migrating their Solana and Bitcoin (BRC-20) assets to runs.</p>

<li>add capability for the Movement atomic bridge to swap MOVE on Bitcoin for MOVE on Movement</li>

<h2 id="overview-12"><a class="header" href="#overview-12">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Bridges require a sustainable fee mechanism to prevent abuse and ensure they can self-sustain operations. This proposal outlines a dynamic fee structure for both the Ethereum and Movement chains. On the Ethereum side, fees will adjust according to gas price volatility, while on the Movement side, an oracle service will monitor and update gas prices in real time.

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Proposal for simplifying the native bridge mechanism using an attester-based approach and drawing inspiration from USDC’s CCTP. The goal is to reducing friction, cost, and complexity for Layer 2 onboarding.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:primata@movementlabs.xyz">Primata</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-13"><a class="header" href="#overview-13">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This MD lays out steps to introduce and leverage an <strong>attester-based bridge model</strong> to create a frictionless, efficient, and secure cross-chain experience for Movement technologies.</p>
<p>A bridge mechanism is essential for any Layer 2 solution, serving as the user’s first interaction with the network. This process must be smooth and frictionless, ensuring that dealing with tokens on L1 and bridging to native gas tokens on L2 does not overcomplicate the user experience. The bridge must balance user onboarding, cost-efficiency, and simplicity, while minimizing transaction complexity.</p>
<p>We request to</p>
<ol>
<li>draw inspiration from the <a href="https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started">Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol</a> (CCTP) protocol by USDC, which offers an elegant solution to these challenges.</li>
<li>Apply an attester based model to the native bridge.</li>
<li>Supply a clear flow for the bridge mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="motivation-31"><a class="header" href="#motivation-31">Motivation</a></h3>
<p>Our current bridge solution has been increasing in complexity with each iteration. Originally requiring three on-chain transactions, it now requires four, initiate bridge, lock, complete source chain, complete target chain. Additionally, the bridge does not currently support gas charging mechanisms to prevent exploits, and ongoing discussions are leaning toward adding further components, making it even more complex and computationally expensive.</p>
<p>We believe the best approach is to draw from live implementations that have achieved a streamlined user experience with minimal cost to the user. One such example is USDC’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol">CCTP</a>, which offers simplicity, security, and efficiency in cross-chain bridging. Instead of increasing the complexity of our current bridge design, we should aim to adopt more proven mechanisms.</p>

<h4 id="user-journey"><a class="header" href="#user-journey">User Journey</a></h4>
<p>The developer can understand the <a href="https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/generic-message-passing">Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)</a> model and draw from it to design a bridge mechanism that is simple, secure, and efficient.</p>
<h4 id="description"><a class="header" href="#description">Description</a></h4>
<p>The CCTP operates using a set of attesters that validate all bridge transactions occurring between chains. These attesters listen for bridge events, confirm the validity of transactions, and, if necessary, revert them by providing appropriate proofs. A transfer allowance managed by a centralized authority further ensures that breaches are mitigated by limiting the amount of value transferred.</p>
<h4 id="justification"><a class="header" href="#justification">Justification</a></h4>
<p><strong>Already operational</strong>
Relying on a protocol like CCTP that has been tested in live environments significantly reduces the risk of any unexpected utilization of off-chain and on-chain proofs. It is also operational and widely adopted.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction of messages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An on-chain component on source domain emits a message.</li>
<li>Circle’s off-chain attestation service signs the message.</li>
<li>The on-chain component at the destination domain receives the message, and forwards the message body to the specified recipient.</li>
</ol>
<p>This results in 2 onchain transactions and 1 offchain transaction. Comparatively, HTLC requires 4 onchain transactions.</p>
<p>This approach minimizes the need for additional components and avoids the reliance on synthetic assets, leading to a simplified and cost-effective bridge solution.</p>
<h4 id="recommendations-2"><a class="header" href="#recommendations-2">Recommendations</a></h4>
<p><strong>Reference Implementation</strong>
For more details on how this model operates, refer to USDC’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) documentation:<br />
<a href="https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/generic-message-passing">USDC CCTP Overview</a></p>

<h4 id="user-journey-1"><a class="header" href="#user-journey-1">User Journey</a></h4>
<p>The developer can implement a bridge mechanism that uses a multisig scheme.</p>
<h4 id="justification-1"><a class="header" href="#justification-1">Justification</a></h4>
<p><strong>Security Implications</strong>:
The use of a multisig setup adds a layer of security, with aggregated signatures preventing unauthorized access. The transfer allowance mechanism further mitigates potential breaches by limiting how much can be transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Impacts</strong>:
Because we would use a multisig off-chain signature to complete bridges, the set of attesters and the multisig address to produce the signature that we have to check the message against it could be the same set of the L2 Settlement signers.
This method reduces the computational overhead associated with multiple on-chain transactions and simplifies the bridge process. The reliance on a proven mechanism ensures minimal performance degradation. It also provides a bridging service with 1:1 bridging with minimal logic that could be potentially used for exploits.
It could also facilitate aggregating bridges since a merkle root could be used to handle the validity of the logic.</p>
<p><strong>Validation Procedures</strong>:
Formal and machine-aided validation of the off-chain signature and on-chain message handling will be crucial for ensuring the correctness of this proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Peer Review and Community Feedback</strong>:
The approach should be subject to review and feedback from the Movement Labs team and the wider community to ensure that it meets the needs of the ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="recommendations-3"><a class="header" href="#recommendations-3">Recommendations</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge Relayer as Attester</strong>: The Bridge Relayer in our system will function as an attester, operating via a multisig scheme (i.e. the attester collects signatures from a threshold number of comittee members that approve of the message). This relayer, through aggregated signatures, produces a proof on a signed message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Interaction</strong>: Users, or other parties interested in completing the bridge, retrieve their funds on the target chain by submitting the signature and message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validation Mechanism</strong>: The off-chain signature produced by the multisig scheme is verified against the message on-chain. As a reference, we could use the same automation scheme as the <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pulls">MIP-18 Stage 0 Upgradeability and Multisigs</a>.
The challenge is to make sure that the signature is only used once so no transaction is replayed, but the beauty is that the signature is provided by a multi-party system that do not need to provide onchain signatures. It’s also important to use a solid architecture that prevents hash mining attacks.</p>

<h4 id="recommendations-4"><a class="header" href="#recommendations-4">Recommendations</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>User Deposits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user deposits tokens on the source chain, which triggers a deposit event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge Relayer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bridge Relayer, listening for the deposit event, picks up the message or messages associated with the deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multisig Signing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The multisig party signs the bridge transaction. The combination of signatures produces an aggregated signature that ties the signatures to the message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Target Chain Verification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the target chain, the aggregated signature and the message are used to verify the validity of the bridge transaction. The withdrawal can only occur if the multisig-provided signature is valid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Withdrawal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the signature is verified, the user can withdraw the corresponding funds on the target chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is bi-directional, allowing funds to be bridged between Layer 1 and Layer 2, and vice versa, with minimal complexity and friction.</p>

<h2 id="overview-15"><a class="header" href="#overview-15">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Move Name Service (MNS) is a system that allows users to register human-readable names on the Movement blockchain. It is designed to facilitate user-friendly interactions, registrations, and transactions on-chain. Expanding beyond traditional name services, MNS introduces the concept of access keys tied to a bonding curve, which determines the minting and burning prices of these keys. The MNS also provides revenue generation mechanisms for both the protocol and name owners.</p>
<p>MNS falls under the SoFi category, offering a decentralized, permissionless framework that encourages community participation to build and iterate on infrastructure and services centered on Names and Rooms.</p>
<h2 id="definitions-7"><a class="header" href="#definitions-7">Definitions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Names</strong>: Human-readable identifiers registered on-chain. Should be freely tradeable. Room ownership is tied to Name. Names domain is <code>.move</code>. E.g. <code>[owned_name].move</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Rooms</strong>: Digital spaces associated with a registered Name, accessible by the Name’s owner or key holders.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong>: Access key to Name’s rooms. Mintable and burnable according to a bonding curve.</li>
<li><strong>Bonding Curve</strong>: A mathematical model used to determine minting and burning prices for access keys.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Users can register human-readable names on the blockchain and access related services.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: A decentralized name system is essential for empowering users with on-chain identities and ensuring they can interact with the blockchain without technical friction.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance and suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names should be fully decentralized and governed by the community, adhering to the principles of openness and transparency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d2-bonding-curve-for-key-minting-and-burning"><a class="header" href="#d2-bonding-curve-for-key-minting-and-burning">D2: Bonding Curve for Key Minting and Burning</a></h3>
<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Users or services can mint or burn access keys based on a bonding curve.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: A bonding curve ensures that access keys’ prices are dynamically adjusted, preventing speculation and enabling fair access to Names and Rooms.</p>
<h3 id="d3-community-driven-revenue-models"><a class="header" href="#d3-community-driven-revenue-models">D3: Community-Driven Revenue Models</a></h3>
<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: The community can implement their own revenue models via Rooms and Keys. Movement drives the first implementation with Ductus, a backend serving the name service and rooms, and Domus, the frontend that allows minting, trading, viewing of names and keys, and using chat rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Allowing the community to drive revenue through their traffic contributions promotes incentivized participation, enabling them to earn protocol-generated funds.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance and suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Rooms and Keys, community members should be able to pass their address as <code>application_fee_recipient</code> to receive funds generated by the traffic they drive to the protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d4-expandable-name-and-room-ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#d4-expandable-name-and-room-ecosystem">D4: Expandable Name and Room Ecosystem</a></h3>
<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Developers can build custom applications and infrastructure using the Name and Room system.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: A flexible framework encourages innovation, enabling third-party developers to create services, tools, or applications that enhance the user experience within the MNS ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance and suggestions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and Room ownership should be tied to flexible access key resources, allowing for extensibility through third-party integrations and custom services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Users acquire a <code>.move</code> domain. This allows the user to host an application running on http/https.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Domains are yet to be fully implemented for any web3 name service and <code>.move</code> is an elegant TLD with intrinsic value for a global market.</p>
<h2 id="design"><a class="header" href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<h3 id="protocol-units"><a class="header" href="#protocol-units">Protocol Units</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>NameRegistry</strong>: Manages the registration and ownership of Names on the Movement blockchain, similar to the Aptos Name Service.</li>
<li><strong>NameKeys</strong>: Manages the minting and burning of access keys tied to Rooms and Names using the bonding curve mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Ductus</strong> (temporary name): A server responsible for generating and serving Rooms’ content off-chain.</li>
<li><strong>Domus</strong> (temporary name): A frontend interface where users can access, message, and manage their Rooms, including features like messaging, timeline integration, and third-party service integration (such as Parthenon).</li>
<li><strong>Community Integrations</strong>: The community can generate revenue on existing infrastructure by driving Keys trading on their own interface by utilizing the <code>application_fee</code> feature. This allows them to find new revenue models that either compete with or improve the Ductus and Domus ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The community can modify these temporary names or replace them with their own infrastructure and branding.</p>
<h2 id="background--motivation"><a class="header" href="#background--motivation">Background &amp; Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Name services are integral to establishing on-chain identities, creating a user-friendly interface for interaction. Move-based name services have historically been owned by the network. The MNS maintains this model while also allowing the community to contribute content and services. The goal is to create a more innovative, community-driven Name Service on the Movement blockchain.</p>
<h3 id="expanded"><a class="header" href="#expanded">Expanded</a></h3>
<p>The Movement Name Service (MNS) goes beyond simply assigning human-readable names by introducing the concept of access keys tied to a bonding curve. This mechanism provides users with more than just an identifier—it adds a layer of value through the potential for ownership, community-building, and monetization. Access keys allow users to unlock private Rooms associated with Names, creating a user-driven ecosystem where participation and engagement with specific names hold tangible economic and social value.</p>
<h4 id="keys-and-bonding-curve"><a class="header" href="#keys-and-bonding-curve">Keys and Bonding Curve</a></h4>
<p>Keys are pivotal to this system. By tying the issuance of keys to a bonding curve, the cost of minting and burning keys dynamically adjusts based on demand, ensuring a fair and transparent market for entry into exclusive rooms. Users who acquire these keys not only gain access to specific digital spaces but also gain a stake in the name’s ecosystem. For example, as more users mint keys to access a popular room, the minting price rises, reflecting the increased demand for that space.</p>
<p>This incentivizes early participation in popular rooms and encourages users to build brands around their names. When these names and associated rooms grow in value and demand, users can sell the keys on secondary markets, benefiting from increased key prices and potential residual earnings tied to those trades.</p>
<h4 id="integrating-sofi-into-mns"><a class="header" href="#integrating-sofi-into-mns">Integrating SoFi into MNS</a></h4>
<p>The integration of SoFi (Social Finance) into the MNS framework amplifies the value of the name service. Rather than tying a name’s worth to external platforms like Twitter or Discord, SoFi enables names to exist as self-contained ecosystems where the owner can control not only their brand but also the flow of interactions and transactions within their domain.</p>
<p>By allowing people to trade well-established names, MNS unlocks additional value—when acquiring a prominent name, users can also gain access to that name’s followers and established community. This creates opportunities for individuals or brands to sell and transfer their influence on the blockchain in a decentralized manner. For developers and entrepreneurs, the introduction of an application fee tied to keys incentivizes the creation of third-party applications that route trades and interactions through their platforms, driving a thriving secondary market for names and keys.</p>
<p>In this model, the name service and key market extend far beyond the initial design, encouraging continual growth and evolution as users build their own applications on top of the MNS framework.</p>
<h4 id="userdeveloper-experience"><a class="header" href="#userdeveloper-experience">User/Developer Experience</a></h4>
<p>For users, the experience of interacting with MNS is streamlined and intuitive. Registering a name or purchasing access keys involves interacting with simple on-chain functions, all while benefiting from the bonding curve’s dynamic pricing. As users participate in these interactions, they become integral parts of the MNS ecosystem, with the potential to trade, mint, or burn keys as demand shifts. This flexibility provides users with agency over their digital spaces and monetization paths.</p>
<p>For developers, MNS presents a unique opportunity to create value-added services. By integrating with the bonding curve for keys, developers can create custom frontends or applications where users manage their names and keys, while collecting application fees on trades. This creates a lucrative ecosystem where developers benefit from user engagement and traffic on their platforms.</p>

<p><img src="Review/l-monninger/provisions-for-fixed-token-supply/MD/md-38/./fixed-supply-rewarding-problem.png" alt="Fixed Supply Rewarding Problem" /></p>
<p>Using Fast Finality Settlement with the Native Bridge presents a challenge when the token supply is fixed.</p>
<p>Burning token on the L2 without a way to return it to pools on the L2 or the L1 will result in a <strong>deflationary token</strong>, i.e., the supply decreases over time and eventually reaches 0 rendering any operations relying on gas impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, providing minting capabilities which involve the operation of fallible services can result in the violation of a constant supply principle and lead to <strong>either a deflationary or inflationary token</strong> and the opportunity for <strong>byzantine attacks</strong>.</p>
<p>Using FFS-Postconfirmation requires a reward scheme on L1. On the other hand, users pay fees on L2 into an L2 pool. Namely, in this context, trying to use the same token for both L2 gas and L1 rewards requires that the token be bridged back over from L2 to L1, or else rely on a trusted signer to relay the gas. This document outlines the challenges and potential solutions for this problem.</p>
<p>Users of the Movement SDK should be <strong>informed of different approaches and trade-offs when using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply.</strong> This document provides an initial conceptual framing towards that end.</p>
<p>This document also seeks a response to the concerns raised in <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/20">MD-20</a>.</p>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Developers can reference MIPs for <strong>different approaches to using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply.</strong> Developers can also <strong>reference rejected MIPs</strong> to understand why certain approaches are not recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Developers need a clear understanding of the different approaches to using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply. MIPs provide a clear and standardized way to document these approaches.</p>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Developers can reference approaches spawned from these desiderata to understand how to build networks using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply <strong>in stages.</strong> For example, developers can initially roll out a network using the <strong>“Free Execution” approach and then transition to the “Noble Attester”</strong> approach and so on. Some formats may be more suitable for certain stages of network development and release than others.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Developers need a clear understanding of how to build networks using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply in stages. This allows developers to roll out networks in a more controlled and manageable way.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that achieving upgrades for each execution layer to support these transitions are also documented in MIPs.</li>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Developers can use guides and software from the Movement SDK to understand how to set up the <strong>initial conditions of L1 and L2 networks</strong> using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Developers need a clear understanding of how to set up the initial conditions of L1 and L2 networks using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement. This allows developers to build networks using the Native Bridge and Fast Finality Settlement with a fixed token supply more easily. For example, one possible usage approach could be to generate an initial supply on the L1 and run a privileged bridge and voucher swap exchange to the L2 such that overall circulation is grounded in the L1 mint.</p>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: Developers, exchanges, and users can understand why the bridge can be assumed reasonably secure and inherent fallibility is within network security contraints given a set of assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: We can argue, for example, that many other bridge services use a trusted signer and that said trusted signer is uncomprimised is a fundamental and acceptable assumption.</p>

<p><strong>User Journey</strong>: A network participant can understand how gas fees are distributed.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Gas fees must ultimately be used to pay extrinsic costs or else be considered as rewards. It is important to specify how gas fees are distributed to ensure that the system is fair and that the incentives for participation are aligned with the goals of the Movement Network.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Provide a component that informs about the total circulating supply of $MOVE across L1 and L2.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="mailto:andreas.penzkofer@movementlabs.xyz">Author</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-18"><a class="header" href="#overview-18">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Several components should react if the bridge is under attack or faulty. In particular, the considered components are the Insurance Fund, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/50">MIP-50</a> and the Rate Limiter, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/56">MIP-56</a>, and more generally the governance operator.</p>
<p>The Operator that controls these components requires knowledge about the states of minted or locked tokens on L1 and L2. The Operator is an entity (e.g. multisig human) that has the ability to sign transactions and send funds from the Security Fund. Moreover, the operation of these components may also be handled via a governance, which could also rely on state information.</p>
<p>This MD requests to provide an informing service that satisfies the above.</p>
<h2 id="desiderata-16"><a class="header" href="#desiderata-16">Desiderata</a></h2>
<h3 id="d1-provide-information-about-the-circulating-supply-on-l2"><a class="header" href="#d1-provide-information-about-the-circulating-supply-on-l2">D1: Provide information about the circulating supply on L2</a></h3>
<p>On the L2 the bridge contract mints $MOVE token when token should be transferred to L2. When tokens are transferred to L1, the user burns provably some tokens on L2. The Informer should learn about those two supplies and provide information about the current circulating $MOVE supply on L2.</p>
<h3 id="d2-provide-information-about-the-locked-supply-on-l1"><a class="header" href="#d2-provide-information-about-the-locked-supply-on-l1">D2: Provide information about the locked supply on L1</a></h3>
<p>On the L1 the L1 bridge contract locks any $MOVE token that should be transferred to L2 in a bridge pool. When $MOVE token should be transferred to L1 the L1 bridge contract releases tokens held by the bridge pool. The operator should be informed about the locked amount.</p>
<h3 id="d3-optional-provide-information-about-the-inflight-tokens"><a class="header" href="#d3-optional-provide-information-about-the-inflight-tokens">D3: Optional: Provide information about the inflight tokens</a></h3>
<p>Provide information about the inflight tokens. This includes tokens that are not yet processed by the relayer, as well as tokens that are processed (i.e. the <code>complete</code> transaction is in a block on the target chain) but not yet finalized.</p>
<h3 id="d4-define-what-it-means-for-the-native-bridge-to-be-secure"><a class="header" href="#d4-define-what-it-means-for-the-native-bridge-to-be-secure">D4: Define what it means for the Native Bridge to be secure</a></h3>
<p>Based on the variables above the informer should derive a metric that can provide a warning if the metric seems incorrect. It has to be defined what means incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="d5-explore-implications-if-relayer-does-not-utilize-postconfirmations"><a class="header" href="#d5-explore-implications-if-relayer-does-not-utilize-postconfirmations">D5: Explore implications if relayer does not utilize postconfirmations</a></h3>
<p>The postconfirmation process is a synchronization mechanism for L2 to L1, see <a href="https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/MIP/pull/37">MIP-37</a>.</p>
<p>If the Relayer completes transfers from L2 to L1 without awaiting postconfirmation of the L2 <code>initiate</code> transaction, synchronization guarantees are reduced. The postconfirmation is an anchoring mechanism that binds the L2 to a certain L2 block height and hash, and hinders reorgs beyond a certain depth on L2.</p>
<p>We need to check the implications for the Informer if the Relayer ignores postconfirmations.</p>

<p>A token that is subject to a demurrage fee, which is a fee charged for holding the token. The fee is typically charged as a percentage of the token’s value and is intended to encourage spending or investment rather than hoarding.</p>
<p>Practically, any token which by design has a negative interest rate–a value tending towards zero over time–can be considered a demurrage token.</p>
