## FFS = Fast-Finality Settlement
The objective of the FFS protocol is to confirm that transactions are processed correctly and back this confirmation through crypto-economic security. It does not relate to the ordering of transactions.

## Validator
A validator is a node that participates in the FFS protocol. Validators execute transactions and sequencer-batches and validate their correctness. Validators are rewarded for their work.
#### Alternative names
**Attester (deprecated)** - The term Attester has been deprecated in favor of Validator.

## Sequencer-Batch 
The block of transactions that is provided by the sequencer.
#### Alternative names
**Batch** - Less clean, but more common term for Sequencer-Batch. May be mixed up with the batch of transactions sent to the sequencer.

## L2-Block
A block of transactions that is processed by the FFS protocol. It contains information about the state root produced by the transactions in the block.
#### Alternative names
**Block** - Less clean, but more common term for L2-Block. May be mixed up with the term 

## Postconfirmation
The process of confirming a (sequence of) blocks after it has been processed by the FFS protocol on L1.
