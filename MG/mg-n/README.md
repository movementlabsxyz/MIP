# MG-n: demurrage token
- **Authors**: [Liam Monninger](liam@movementlabs.xyz)

A token that is subject to a demurrage fee, which is a fee charged for holding the token. The fee is typically charged as a percentage of the token's value and is intended to encourage spending or investment rather than hoarding.

Practically, any token which by design has a negative interest rate--a value tending towards zero over time--can be considered a demurrage token.
