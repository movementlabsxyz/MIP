  READ MIP-0 BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE!

  This is the suggested template for new MIPs. After you have filled in the requisite fields, please delete these comments.

  Note that an MIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your MIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `README.md`.

  The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the MIP number in title, irrespective of the category.

  The author should add himself as a code owner in the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file for the MIP.

## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the MIP solves. It should not describe how the MIP solves those problems.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

_The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174._

## Reference implementation

<!--
  The reference implementation section should include links to and an overview of a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.

## Verification

<!--

  All proposals must contain a section that discusses the various aspects of verification pertinent to the introduced changes. This section should address:

  1. **Correctness**: Ensure that the proposed changes behave as expected in all scenarios. Highlight any tests, simulations, or proofs done to validate the correctness of the changes.

  2. **Security Implications**: Address the potential security ramifications of the proposal. This includes discussing security-relevant design decisions, potential vulnerabilities, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance, and pitfalls. Mention any threats, risks, and mitigation strategies associated with the proposal.

  3. **Performance Impacts**: Outline any performance tests conducted and the impact of the proposal on system performance. This could be in terms of speed, resource consumption, or other relevant metrics.

  4. **Validation Procedures**: Describe any procedures, tools, or methodologies used to validate the proposal against its requirements or objectives. 

  5. **Peer Review and Community Feedback**: Highlight any feedback from peer reviews or the community that played a crucial role in refining the verification process or the proposal itself.

Needs discussion.

## Appendix
<!--
  The Appendix should contain an enumerated list of reference materials and notes.

  When referenced elsewhere each appendix should be called out with [A<number>](#A<number>) and should have a matching header.

Nothing important here.

## Changelog

<!--
  The Changelog should be maintained after publication.

  1. **Transparency and Clarity**: The Changelog acknowledges any corrections made post-publication, ensuring that readers are not misled and are always equipped with the most accurate information.

  2. **Accountability**: By noting changes openly, we maintain a high level of responsibility and ownership over our content. It’s an affirmation that we value precision and are ready to correct oversights.

  Each Changelog should briefly describe each change made, accompanied by a reference to the date, version and PR in which the change was implemented.

  The format should be as follows:
  - **YYYY-MM-DD**: Description of change. [PR#](link-to-PR)

  TODO: Maintain this comment.
