# MD-30: Movement Name Service

- **Description**: Define the structure for the Movement Name Service (MNS) on the Movement blockchain, providing a user-friendly way for users to interact with names and rooms through bonding curve-based access keys.

## Overview

The Move Name Service (MNS) is a system that allows users to register human-readable names on the Movement blockchain. It is designed to facilitate user-friendly interactions, registrations, and transactions on-chain. Expanding beyond traditional name services, MNS introduces the concept of access keys tied to a bonding curve, which determines the minting and burning prices of these keys. The MNS also provides revenue generation mechanisms for both the protocol and name owners.

MNS falls under the SoFi category, offering a decentralized, permissionless framework that encourages community participation to build and iterate on infrastructure and services centered on Names and Rooms.

## Definitions

- **Names**: Human-readable identifiers registered on-chain.
- **Rooms**: Digital spaces associated with a registered Name, accessible by the Name's owner or key holders.
- **Bonding Curve**: A mathematical model used to determine minting and burning prices for access keys.

## Desiderata

### D1: Decentralized and Permissionless Name System

**User Journey**: Users can register human-readable names on the blockchain and access related services.

**Justification**: A decentralized name system is essential for empowering users with on-chain identities and ensuring they can interact with the blockchain without technical friction.

**Guidance and suggestions**:

- Names should be fully decentralized and governed by the community, adhering to the principles of openness and transparency.

### D2: Bonding Curve for Key Minting and Burning

**User Journey**: Users or services can mint or burn access keys based on a bonding curve.

**Justification**: A bonding curve ensures that access keys' prices are dynamically adjusted, preventing speculation and enabling fair access to Names and Rooms.

### D3: Community-Driven Revenue Models

**User Journey**: The community can implement their own revenue models via Rooms and Keys. Movement drives the first implementation with Ductus, a backend serving the name service and rooms, and Domus, the frontend that allows minting, trading, viewing of names and keys, and using chat rooms.

**Justification**: Allowing the community to drive revenue through their traffic contributions promotes incentivized participation, enabling them to earn protocol-generated funds.

**Guidance and suggestions**:

- For Rooms and Keys, community members should be able to pass their address as `application_fee_recipient` to receive funds generated by the traffic they drive to the protocol.

### D4: Expandable Name and Room Ecosystem

**User Journey**: Developers can build custom applications and infrastructure using the Name and Room system.

**Justification**: A flexible framework encourages innovation, enabling third-party developers to create services, tools, or applications that enhance the user experience within the MNS ecosystem.

**Guidance and suggestions**:

- Name and Room ownership should be tied to flexible access key resources, allowing for extensibility through third-party integrations and custom services.

## Design

### Protocol Units

- **NameRegistry**: Manages the registration and ownership of Names on the Movement blockchain, similar to the Aptos Name Service.
- **NameKeys**: Manages the minting and burning of access keys tied to Rooms and Names using the bonding curve mechanism.
- **Ductus** (temporary name): A server responsible for generating and serving Rooms' content off-chain.
- **Domus** (temporary name): A frontend interface where users can access, message, and manage their Rooms, including features like messaging, timeline integration, and third-party service integration (such as Parthenon).
- **Community Integrations**: Community can generate revenue on existent infrastructure by driving Keys trading on their own interface by utilizing the `application_fee` feature. This allows them to find new revenue models that either compete or improve the Ductus and Domus ecosystem.

The community can modify these temporary names or replace them with their own infrastructure and branding.

## Disclaimers

- This initiative is a potential continuation of the "Building the Parthenon" project.
- The MNS system is open and permissionless, meaning Movement Labs is not responsible for content or services built by the Community Movement.
  
## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

- Establish a framework for the MNS system that is open and permissionless.
- Provide the minimum viable feature set for registering and managing Names and Rooms.
- Enable the community to iterate on the system and create content, infrastructure, and services based on Names and Rooms.

### Non-Goals

- Define the full scope of the MNS system beyond its initial implementation.
- Prescribe how the Community Movement will build upon or extend the system.

## Timeline

- **Q4 2024**:
  - Finalize module designs and implementation.
  - Deploy modules to testnet.
  - Design and build the `Domus` frontend interface and `Ductus` server.
- **Q1 2025**:
  - Launch the NameRegistry and key management modules on mainnet.
  - Community-driven integrations incentives.

## Background & Motivation

Name services are integral to establishing on-chain identities, creating a user-friendly interface for interaction. Move-based name services have historically been owned by the network. The MNS maintains this model while also allowing the community to contribute content and services. The goal is to create a more innovative, community-driven Name Service on the Movement blockchain.

## Operations

The protocol should utilize a bonding curve model for minting and burning access keys, with funds flowing through the following structure:

```move
struct Settings {
    protocol_fee_destination: address,

    application_fee_percent: u64,
    
    protocol_fee_percent: u64,
    subject_fee_percent: u64,
}

#[event]
struct Trade {
    trader: address,
    domain: address,

    application: address,

    is_buy: bool,
    key_amount: u64,
    move_amount: u64,
    protocol_amount: u64,
    domain_amount: u64,

    application_amount: u64,
    
    new_supply: u64,
}
```

## Security/Privacy/Compliance

As this system is decentralized and permissionless, Movement Labs is not responsible for third-party content or services built by the Community Movement. The community may establish their own privacy and security mechanisms.

## Risks

Community-driven services may introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities or suboptimal practices if not properly vetted.

## Appendix

- Revisions:
  - Initial RFC Creation: 02232024
  - Update: Moved timeline to Q4 2024 to include community contributions. Final design and implementation shifted accordingly.
  - There is a [preliminary sketch of the implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/0xPrimata/movement-names-contracts). If accepted, this should be moved to the official Movement Labs GitHub repository for further development and refinement.
  - First reference to Movement Name Service is available as an [RFC](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/rfcs/blob/move-name-service/draft-move-name-service/rfc-move-name-service.md).
