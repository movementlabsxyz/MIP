# MD-91: Define Move Stack and Movement SDK

- **Description**: Define the Move Stack and the Movement SDK to provide clear categorization of our software components and standardize language around the Movement technologies.
- **Authors**: Andreas Penzkofer

## Overview

The Move Stack and Movement SDK are foundational components for Movement technologies, aimed at empowering developers with standardized tools, interfaces, and services for building, interacting with, and maintaining Movement Labs' networks and dApps.

## Desiderata

### D1: Standardization of Development Stack

**User Journey**: Developers can utilize a well-documented stack to build and maintain Movement Labs' networks and dApps.

**Justification**: Ensures high quality of documentation.

### D2: Create Categories for Move Stack components

**User Journey**: Developers are able to have an easy access to which category is relevant to them.

**Justification**: The Move Stack may be extensive and complex, so categorization is necessary. It will accelerate for developers to find their way within the stack.

### D2: Categorization of Software Components

**User Journey**: Software components are clearly categorized and associated with categories within the Move Stack.

**Justification**: Categorization of Software components helps to provide consistent documentation and may aid in framing the documentation. It also provides a clear and consistent language for discussing Movement technologies.

### D3: Vizualization of the Move Stack

**User Journey**: Developers can easily understand the Move Stack and its components.

**Justification**: Visualization of the Move Stack will help developers to understand the components and their relationships.

### D4: Reduce confusion between SDK and Stack

**User Journey**: Developers are able to understand what the SDK implies.

**Justification**: There has been much confusion about what the SDK constitutes. There is great need for clarification to align language in the ecosystem.
