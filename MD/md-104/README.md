# MD-104: Formalize Pre‑Mortem Process for Risk Mitigation

- **Description**: Standardize a pre‑mortem process to proactively identify catastrophic risks and drive actionable mitigation measures in Movement’s blockchain operations.
- **Authors**: [Elliott Dehnbostel](mailto:elliott.dehnbostel@movementlabs.xyz)

## Overview

Pre‑mortem sessions are structured risk assessments that simulate potential catastrophic failure scenarios before they occur. This process helps uncover hidden vulnerabilities, drive proactive planning, and foster cross‑functional collaboration. By formalizing this process, Movement Labs can enhance its risk awareness, improve operational resilience, and ensure that actionable steps are taken to mitigate identified risks.

## Desiderata

### D1: Regularly Scheduled and Structured Pre‑Mortem Sessions

- **User Journey**: Leadership, technical teams, and security experts can participate in scheduled sessions to analyze potential catastrophic scenarios.
- **Justification**: Regular sessions ensure continuous risk evaluation and timely identification of vulnerabilities, improving preparedness for unlikely but high‑impact events.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Frequency**: Host bi‑weekly sessions for technical teams and quarterly sessions for business leadership.
  - **Facilitation**: Designate a rotating facilitator to guide discussion and ensure a structured format.
  - **Participation**: Involve a diverse group from technical, security, and operational teams.

### D2: Comprehensive Scenario Development

- **User Journey**: Participants can collaboratively craft detailed narratives that outline potential disaster scenarios, including triggers, impacts, and recovery challenges.
- **Justification**: Detailed scenario narratives help teams understand the full spectrum of risks and identify root causes, leading to more effective preventive measures.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Data‑Driven Selection**: Pre‑select scenarios using current operational risks, historical data, and game‑theoretic analysis.
  - **Narrative Detailing**: Ensure each scenario includes triggers, cascading impacts, and potential recovery challenges.
  - **Documentation**: Record scenarios in a standardized template for consistency.

### D3: Actionable Outcomes and Follow‑Up

- **User Journey**: After a session, stakeholders can immediately implement recommended actions to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
- **Justification**: The true value of pre‑mortems lies in transforming theoretical risks into concrete, actionable improvement plans.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Outcome Documentation**: Record actionable insights and assign clear responsibilities with feasible deadlines.
  - **Integration**: Incorporate session findings into the broader risk management process.
  - **Accountability**: Set up follow‑up reviews to ensure action items are implemented and evaluated over time.

### D4: Cross‑Functional Collaboration and Transparency

- **User Journey**: Different teams (technical, security, and business) collaborate openly during sessions to contribute diverse perspectives on risk.
- **Justification**: A multidisciplinary approach ensures that a wide range of potential failure modes is considered, leading to more robust risk mitigation strategies.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Diverse Participation**: Ensure representation from all relevant departments.
  - **Open Dialogue**: Foster an environment that encourages honest and candid discussion.
  - **Shared Documentation**: Make session outcomes accessible to all stakeholders for continuous learning and improvement.
