  ### User-facing Suzuka Checks

  **User Journey**: Users get more assurance that we know when Suzuka testnet has a transaction-processing outage. 

  **Description**:

- Implement e2e tests which are already packaged as containers. See https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/movement/tree/main/networks/suzuka/suzuka-client/src/bin/e2e for the test logic and https://github.com/orgs/movementlabsxyz/packages?repo_name=movement for the containers (those with e2e in the name).

- Run these checks periodically, say once every 3 minutes, to simulate users sending transactions, and add to monitoring infrastructure, reporting based on the exit code of the e2e test binaries and not requiring any modifications to the implementation.

(See @l-monninger comments in discussion.)

**Justification**:

  It's a high priority to have testnet running and able to process transactions, or alterting us otherwise.

**Guidance and suggestions**: 

  We will need the address for this job allowlisted to use the Suzuka testnet faucet.


## Errata
<!--
  Errata should be maintained after publication.

  1. **Transparency and Clarity**: An erratum acknowledges any corrections made post-publication, ensuring that readers are not misled and are always equipped with the most accurate information.

  2. **Accountability**: By noting errors openly, we maintain a high level of responsibility and ownership over our content. Itâ€™s an affirmation that we value precision and are ready to correct oversights.

  Each erratum should briefly describe the discrepancy and the correction made, accompanied by a reference to the date and version of the desiderata in which the error was identified.
