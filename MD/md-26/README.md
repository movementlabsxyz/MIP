  ### Desideratum Title

  **User Journey**: Users get more assurance that we know when Suzuka testnet has a transaction-processing outage. 

  **Description**:

  1. Spin up an EC2 instance.
  
  2. On the instance, create a shell script `suzuka_user_test.sh`:

        ```
        #!/bin/bash

        # Define variables (replace with actual values)
        ACCOUNT_KEY="your_account_key"
        PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
        APTOS_URL="https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com"
        
        # Infinite loop to send a transaction every 3 minutes
        while true
        do
        # Get faucet funding
        aptos account fund-with-faucet --account $ACCOUNT_KEY --url $APTOS_URL --faucet-url https://faucet.testnet.aptoslabs.com

        # Send a transaction (replace with something simple e.g. a `movemania::play` (tapping game) call?`)
        movement move run --function-id "0x1::module::function_name" --args "u64:1" \
                --account $ACCOUNT_KEY --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --url $APTOS_URL

        echo "Transaction submitted at $(date)"
        
        # Wait for 3 minutes
        sleep 180
        done
        ```

3. Run the script:

        ```
        chmod +x suzuka_user_test.sh
        ./suzuka_user_test.sh
        ```

**Justification**:

  It's a high priority to have testnet running and able to process transactions, or alterting us otherwise.

**Guidance and suggestions**: 

  We will need the address for this job allowlisted to use the Suzuka testnet faucet.


## Errata
<!--
  Errata should be maintained after publication.

  1. **Transparency and Clarity**: An erratum acknowledges any corrections made post-publication, ensuring that readers are not misled and are always equipped with the most accurate information.

  2. **Accountability**: By noting errors openly, we maintain a high level of responsibility and ownership over our content. Itâ€™s an affirmation that we value precision and are ready to correct oversights.

  Each erratum should briefly describe the discrepancy and the correction made, accompanied by a reference to the date and version of the desiderata in which the error was identified.
