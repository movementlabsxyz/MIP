# MD-4: Long Range Attacks
- **Description**: Provide models for the game theory of long-range attacks in MCR.
- **Authors**: [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@movementlabs.xyz)


## Overview
Long-range attacks are an inherent vulnerability to PoS networks and a subject of prescient research. We request that the relevance of these attacks to MCR be formally modeled and considered. 

## Desiderata

<!--
  List out the specific desiderata. Each entry should consist of:

  1. Title: A concise name for the desideratum.
  2. User Journey: A one or two-sentence statement focusing on the "user" (could be a human, machine, software, etc.) and their interaction or experience.
  3. Description (optional): A more detailed explanation if needed.
  4. Justification: The reasoning behind the desideratum. Why is it necessary or desired?
  5. Recommendations (optional): Suggestions or guidance related to the desideratum.

  Format as:

  ### Desideratum Title

  **User Journey**: [user] can [action].

  **Description**: <More detailed explanation if needed (optional)>

  **Justification**: <Why this is a significant or required desideratum>

  **Recommendations**: <Any specific guidance or suggestions (optional)>

### D1: Evaluate the Opportunity for "Simple" Long-range Attacks and Detection Thereof
**User Journey**: A researcher or protocol implement can understand how a simple long-range attack could be executed and detected in MCR.

**Justification**: Long-range attacks are a known vulnerability to PoS networks. Providing a model which demonstrates how a simple long-range attack could be executed and detected in MCR could enabled us to derive preventative measures.

### D2: Evaluate the Opportunity for Posterior Corruption Long-range Attacks and Detection Thereof
**User Journey**: A researcher or protocol implement can understand how a posterior corruption long-range attack could be executed and detected in MCR.

**Justification**: Posterior corruption long-range attacks are a known vulnerability to PoS networks. Providing a model which demonstrates how a posterior corruption long-range attack could be executed and detected in MCR could enabled us to derive preventative measures.

### D3: Evaluate the Opportunity for Stake-bleeding Long-range Attacks and Detection Thereof
**User Journey**: A researcher or protocol implement can understand how a stake-bleeding long-range attack could be executed and detected in MCR.

**Justification**: Stake-bleeding long-range attacks are a known vulnerability to PoS networks. Providing a model which demonstrates how a stake-bleeding long-range attack could be executed and detected in MCR could enabled us to derive preventative measures.

## Errata
<!--
  Errata should be maintained after publication.

  1. **Transparency and Clarity**: An erratum acknowledges any corrections made post-publication, ensuring that readers are not misled and are always equipped with the most accurate information.

  2. **Accountability**: By noting errors openly, we maintain a high level of responsibility and ownership over our content. Itâ€™s an affirmation that we value precision and are ready to correct oversights.

  Each erratum should briefly describe the discrepancy and the correction made, accompanied by a reference to the date and version of the desiderata in which the error was identified.
