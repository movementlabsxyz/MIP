## Overview

Provide formal structure for proposing non-trivial improvements to Movement. This should be used for specifying complex changes to Movement technologies--particularly those that may require third-parties to adjust their usage of said technologies.

## Definitions

Provide definitions that you think will empower the reader to quickly dive into the topic.

## Desiderata

### D1: Draft and publish standardized proposals

**User Journey**: Proposer/Researcher can adhere to a standardized template for proposing changes to Movement technologies.

**Justification**: Offering a standardized means for researching a proposing changes to Movement technologies will help guide research both in written structure and by facilitating engagement. The likelihood of producing successful proposals from such a structure should be expected to be higher than otherwise.

### D2: Implement against clear and accountable specifications

**User Journey**: Developers can confidently implement complex systems against a clear and accountable specification.

**Justification**: The standardization and review process should produce clearer specifications. The contributors responsible for these specifications should be--encouraging higher quality.

**Guidance and suggestions**:

- As referenced above, the formalized proposals supported by the desired process should be reserved for changes to Movement technologies that are of the highest complexity and quality. Otherwise, the effort of the standardization will likely be counterproductive.
