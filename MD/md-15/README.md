# MD-15: Movement Glossary

- **Description**: Provide a glossary for Movement Vocabulary.
- **Authors**: [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@movementlabs.xyz)
- **Reviewer**: Andreas Penzkofer

## Overview

In order to communicate with more specificity in all contexts, Movement Labs should introduce a glossary. This glossary should define terms both unique to Movement Labs and general terms that are used in a unique way, underspecified in the literature, or have a specific meaning in the context of Movement Labs.

## Desiderata

### D1: Have a common format for a glossary entry (Gloss)

**Justification**: A common format for glossary entries will make it easier to maintain and update the glossary.

**Recommendations**:

- Create a new formatted document for glossary entries in the MIP repository. Call this document an MG, short for Movement Gloss.
- Include sections for (1) term, (2) authorship, (3) concise definition, (4) catalog of references to definitions or usages of the term in other contexts, (5) example usages, and (6) errata.
- Encourage formalism where applicable.

### D2: Introduce glossary terms via an MIP

**Justification**: Introducing glossary terms via an MIP will allow for a more formal process for introducing new terms.

**Recommendations**:

- MD can also introduce MG to further aid in clarity, but they will not be ratified until they have been supported in an MIP.
