- **Description**: Provide a glossary for Movement Vocabulary.
- **Authors**: [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@movementlabs.xyz)
- **Reviewer**: Andreas Penzkofer
- **Approval**: :white_check_mark:

## Overview
In order to communicate with more specificity in all contexts, Movement Labs should introduce a glossary. This glossary should define terms both unique to Movement Labs and general terms that are used in a unique way, underspecified in the literature, or have a specific meaning in the context of Movement Labs.

## Desiderata

<!--
  List out the specific desiderata. Each entry should consist of:

  1. Title: A concise name for the desideratum.
  2. User Journey: A one or two-sentence statement focusing on the "user" (could be a human, machine, software, etc.) and their interaction or experience.
  3. Description (optional): A more detailed explanation if needed.
  4. Justification: The reasoning behind the desideratum. Why is it necessary or desired?
  5. Recommendations (optional): Suggestions or guidance related to the desideratum.

  Format as:

  ### Desideratum Title

  **User Journey**: [user] can [action].

  **Description**: <More detailed explanation if needed (optional)>

  **Justification**: <Why this is a significant or required desideratum>

  **Recommendations**: <Any specific guidance or suggestions (optional)>

  TODO: Remove this comment before finalizing.

### D1: Have a Common Format for a Glossary Entry (Gloss)

**Justification**: A common format for glossary entries will make it easier to maintain and update the glossary.

**Recommendations**: 
- Create a new formatted document for glossary entries in the MIP repository. Call this document an MG, short for Movement Gloss.
- Include sections for (1) term, (2) authorship, (3) concise definition, (4) catalog of references to definitions or usages of the term in other contexts, (5) example usages, and (6) errata.
- Encourage formalism where applicable.

### D2: Introduce Glossary Terms via an MIP

**Justification**: Introducing glossary terms via an MIP will allow for a more formal process for introducing new terms.

**Recommendations**:
- MD can also introduce MG to further aid in clarity, but they will not be ratified until they have been supported in an MIP.
