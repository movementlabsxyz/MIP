## Overview

Technology vision and current state publication strategy should be communicated to the community. We need a streamlined process for this.

## Desiderata

### D1: Identify the target audience

**User journey (Author)**: The author knows which audience we are writing for.

**Description**: Public documents should be targeted for a specific set of audience. Otherwise they miss their goals.

**Recommendation**: Consider the following audience types:

- Technical audience: Engineers, architects, etc.
- Business audience: Product managers, sales, etc.
- Investor audience: Shareholders, potential investors, etc.

### D2: Create a publication product specific for a purpose

**User journey (Author)**: The author knows the purpose of the publication.

**Description**: Publications should be targeted for a specific purpose. Otherwise they miss their goals.

**Recommendation**: Consider the following purposes:

- MIP: Technical excerpt that specify the concrete ideas, technical details and requirements for a technology.
- Blog post: Informal piece that explain the author's thoughts on a technology, and that may be focused on important MIPs.
- Light paper: High-level overview of a technology, and that may include concrete ideas, technical details and requirements. They may be updated when new blog posts are published, or when the technology matures. They are in essence a **live paper**.
- White paper: A long-form piece that provides a deep dive into a technology, and that may include concrete ideas, technical details and requirements. They are the *north stars*, i.e. the technological distinguishing feature of the technology.

### D3: Create a process to make technological vision updates accessible to the community

**User journey (Author)**: The author understands how to transform the technological vision into a publication of some kind.
**User journey (Community)**: The community can access the technological vision in an easy and accessible way.
