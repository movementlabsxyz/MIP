## Glossary

Alphabetically ordered list of terms defined through MGs.

**attester**  (not recommended)
The term attester has been deprecated in favor of validator. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**batch**  
Less clean, but more common term for sequencer-batch. May be mixed up with the batch of transactions sent to the sequencer, or with the batch of L2-blocks that should be processed by the L1-contract. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**block**  
More common term for L2-block. May be mixed up with the batch of transactions sent to the sequencer, the L1-block or with the batch of L2-blocks that should be processed by the L1-contract. So treat with care. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**superBlock**
A range of blocks that are processed by the FFS postconfirmation protocol. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**FFS (Fast Finality Settlement)**  
The objective of the Fast Finality Settlement (FFS) protocol is to confirm that transactions are processed correctly and back this confirmation through crypto-economic security. There are two types of confirmation: postconfirmation and fastconfirmation. It does not relate to the ordering of transactions. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**L2-block**  
A block of transactions that is processed by the FFS protocol. It contains information about the state root produced by the transactions in the block. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**postconfirmation**  
The process of confirming a (sequence of) blocks on L1. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**fastconfirmation**  
The process of confirming a (sequence of) blocks on L2. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**protoBlock**  
The block of transactions that is provided by the sequencer. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)

**validator**  
A validator is a node that participates in the FFS protocol. Validators execute transactions from sequencer batches and validate their correctness. > [MIP-34](./MIP/mip-34)
